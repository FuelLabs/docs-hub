# Claim Genesis Drop

Please visit [app.fuel.network/earn-points/drop/](https://app.fuel.network/earn-points/drop/) to claim your FUEL airdrop. Below is a brief help guide to assist you.

## Check Eligibility

Start by connecting all accounts eligible for Phase 1 of the FUEL airdrop. This includes GitHub accounts, Fuel wallets (both native and non-native), and Ethereum wallets.

You connect all three wallet types at the same time and view the claimable amount for each individual account.

Note that any eligible Ethereum accounts you connect will automatically load their corresponding eligible Fuel accounts. If rewards were earned using a non-Fuel wallet, they will still appear in the Fuel Wallet where the tokens were bridged.

Once you have joined the queue, you will have exactly 10 minutes to claim your FUEL tokens from each of your eligible accounts or else you will have to requeue.

When claiming through an Ethereum wallet, you can connect a Fuel wallet to receive your tokens. Plus, as a bonus, if you don't have any ETH on Fuel Ignition, you’ll get a small amount of  gas to help you claim your Fuel tokens!
