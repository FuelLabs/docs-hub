# How to Stake on Fuel

Please visit [app.fuel.network/staking/on-fuel](https://app.fuel.network/staking/on-fuel) to stake your tokens on the Fuel Shared Sequencer Network through Fuel Ignition. Below, you'll find a helpful guide to get started.

## Connect Fuel Wallet

Start by connecting a Fuel wallet with FUEL tokens. This includes both non-native EVM and SVM wallets.

## Stake

From left to right, you can view your FUEL token balance in your Fuel wallet, your staked FUEL token balance on the shared sequencer network, and your accumulated rewards.

Press the "Stake" button next to your balance to begin the staking process.

Enter the number of tokens you wish to delegate to the validators. Then, click the "Deposit" button to stake your tokens.

Please note: unlike staking on mainnet Ethereum, the validator delegation process is automatically assigned, so you donâ€™t need to manage each validator manually.

After successfully depositing, your total staked token balance will update. The dashboard below will display the distribution of your delegated tokens. In the example diagram, the tokens are distributed evenly among the validators.

## Withdraw

Withdrawing from the shared sequencer network is as simple as staking. Click the "Withdraw" button beside the amount of tokens you have staked.

Your undelegated token balance will return to your Fuel wallet, and the validator dashboard will update accordingly as well.
