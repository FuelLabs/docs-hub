# Documentation Content

All documentation, with the exception of the guides and `intro` section, is pulled in to the `docs-hub` repo via git submodules.

All contributions to the content of the documentation should be done in the original repository.
Below, you will find a list indicating the locations of the source documentation for each book:

## Style Guide

See the [Style Guide](/docs/contributing/style-guide) for guidance on how to edit or write documentation.

## Docs-related GitHub workflows

There are several GitHub actions that run against the docs in each repo to help catch issues. You can learn more about how each of these work in the [`github-actions`](https://github.com/FuelLabs/github-actions/blob/master/docs-hub/README.md) repo.
