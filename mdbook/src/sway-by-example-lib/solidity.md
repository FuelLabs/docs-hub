# Solidity

A quick `Solidity` â†’ `Sway` cross reference for the most commonly used items

- block.timestamp
- msg.sender
- etc

If something is missing here you can most likely find it in the Sway STD Library

```sway
<!-- MDBOOK-INCLUDE-ERROR: File not found '../examples/solidity_cheatsheet/src/main.sw' -->
```
