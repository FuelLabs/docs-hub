# Introduction

Welcome to the Fuel Book, your comprehensive guide to Fuel. This book serves not only as a reference but also reflects our motivations for building Fuel and the philosophies we have incorporated into it.

Our main goal is to dive deeper into the "why" behind Fuel, moving beyond just the technicalities to explore the foundational philosophies and inspirations that guide our work.

We recognize that our audience encompasses developers, researchers, and blockchain enthusiasts. We’ve made it easier to find relevant information, and structured the book with specific sections tailored to different user needs:

**Table of Contents:** Quickly locate specific sections of interest.

**Key Terms and Glossary:** Throughout the book, you will come across terminology unique to the Fuel ecosystem and blockchain, so we included a glossary at the end.

**Visuals:** We also included diagrams and illustrations to clarify complex ideas.

**Further Reading:** At the end of each section, you’ll find recommendations for further reading and resources to deepen your understanding and provide additional context.

**Interactive Components:** For our hands-on learners, we’ve included links to our online resources and community forums. Connect with like-minded Fuel community members and developers to collaborate on learning or building!
