# Networks

On this page, you'll find information on the different testnet networks.

## `beta-3` testnet

<!-- This example should include a description for the latest network -->
<!-- latest_network:example:start -->
The `beta-3` network is the latest Fuel testnet. It expands on the features of `beta-2`, introducing P2P networking and the ability to run synchronizing full nodes.

## `beta-2` testnet

The `beta-2` network is the second Fuel testnet, launched with a bridge to Ethereum's Goerli test network. With this network, developers are able to build and test cross-chain dapps, laying the foundations for projects building on Fuel to tap into Ethereum's massive liquidity and existing user base.

## `beta-1` testnet

The `beta-1` network was the first public Fuel testnet, shared by all developers and users that interacted with it. Developers could deploy contracts to it at will—no permission or whitelisting required—and users could interact with deployed contracts as well. The `beta-1` testnet is no longer running.
