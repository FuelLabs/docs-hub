# The `beta-2` testnet

The `beta-2` network is launched with a bridge to Ethereum's Goerli test network. With this network, developers are able to build and test cross-chain dapps, laying the foundations for projects building on Fuel to tap into Ethereum's massive liquidity and existing user base.

Ethereum contracts (Goerli):

"FuelMessagePortal": `0x4c7181fff2053D232Fc74Ff165b83FE8Dcb65910`

"BinaryMerkleTreeLib": `0x40Ab53ba8BEEe302539f417eCC6C5FBb99F3B7Cd`

"FuelSidechainConsensus": `0xF712e555ce59858f680890DA7dc2B51eD048580d`

"L1ERC20Gateway": `0x96c53cd98B7297564716a8f2E1de2C83928Af2fe`

The ERC-20 Gateway contract on Georli Ethereum is at `0x96c53cd98B7297564716a8f2E1de2C83928Af2fe`.

You can view a test ERC-20 token contract at `0x9c3f3a5a53bD127a51Ae9622EC43488FE6a4DcCd` on Goerli Ethereum with the corresponding Fuel side token contract deployed at `0x250cbf149be078027eed12eba0fe07617b398ccc8ccf1f43a02adddd4e4f8e56` on the `beta-2` testnet.

Goerli block explorer: [https://goerli.etherscan.io/](https://goerli.etherscan.io/)

üö∞ Faucet - Use the faucet to get test ETH to deploy contracts with or to interact with contracts. Available here: [https://faucet-beta-2.fuel.network/](https://faucet-beta-2.fuel.network/).

üìÉ GraphQL endpoint - The Fuel Core node uses GraphQL instead of JSON RPC. A playground for the public GraphQL endpoint for beta-1 is available at [https://node-beta-2.fuel.network/playground](https://node-beta-2.fuel.network/playground).

üîç Block explorer - A block explorer (still heavily in development) is available at [https://fuellabs.github.io/block-explorer-v2/](https://fuellabs.github.io/block-explorer-v2/). Be sure to select `beta-2` from the dropdown on the top right.

Join the [Fuel Labs Discord](https://discord.com/invite/fuelnetwork) and head to the üß™Ô∏±testnet-beta-2 channel to get support from our team.

## SDK Versioning

## Predicate

Messages intended for contracts use a pre-defined predicate as the message recipient. This predicate allows anyone to relay the message to the target contract and only the target contract. Once the contract receives the message it can see who originated it along with any special message payload and processes it accordingly. Since anyone can relay the message using this predicate it opens up possibilities for automated message processing as a service.

The predicate root is `0xc453f2ed45abb180e0a17aa88e78941eb8169c5f949ee218b45afcb0cfd2c0a8`.
