# What is a Modular Execution Layer

In addition to the properties of a rollup, a modular execution is different because it also has these two additional properties:

- With a modular execution layer, users can run an off-chain light client, allowing users to validate the chain without running a full node.

- A modular execution layer is not tightly coupled to a specific layer 1, allowing for greater flexibility.

## Light Clients

One of the core characteristics of a modular execution layer is related to the trust model of the system. A modular execution layer has all the properties of a rollup, and the ability to run a light client. This allows you to have trust-minimized infrastructure. Read more about light clients [here](/docs/about-fuel/the-modular-movement).

## Flexibility

Another core property of a modular execution layer is that it is not tightly coupled to a specific layer 1. This offers flexibility that allows Fuel to be deployed. Read more about Fuel's flexibility [here](/docs/about-fuel/configurations).
