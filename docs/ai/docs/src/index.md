### Data

To retrieve a single document containing all documentation data from the Fuel Network, including information on Sway, the FuelVM, and the Fuel Stack (TypeScript and Rust SDKs), you can visit the [markdown.fuel.network](https://markdown.fuel.network/). This page provides access to a single Markdown file containing all available documentation.

Alternatively, if you prefer a more structured format with separate Markdown files, you can download the latest documentation here: [markdown.fuel.network/multi-fuel-doc.zip](http://markdown.fuel.network/multi-fuel-doc.zip).
