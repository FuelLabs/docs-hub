# Overview

## Introduction to the Fuel GraphQL API

The Fuel GraphQL API allows you to query the Fuel blockchain for a wide range of on-chain data. It can be used to query transactions, balances, block information, and more. You can also use it to simulate and submit transactions on the Fuel network.

## Playground

The playground is an interactive and graphical IDE that includes a reference for queries, mutations, and types. It also provides query validation and context for the underlying GraphQL schema.

You can test out the Fuel GraphQL API playground here:
