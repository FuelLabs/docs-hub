# General

You can find the repository for this website on [GitHub](https://github.com/FuelLabs/docs-hub/tree/master).

## Contribution flow

This is a rough outline of what a contributor's workflow looks like:

- Create a git branch from where you want to base your work. This is usually master.
- Make your changes, and commit your work.
- Run tests and make sure all tests pass.
- Push your changes to a branch in your fork of the repository and submit a pull request.
- Complete the contributor agreement on the PR if it is not already completed.
- Your PR will be reviewed and some changes may be requested.
    - Once you've made changes, your PR must be re-reviewed and approved.
    - If the PR becomes out of date, you can use GitHub's 'update branch' button.
    - If there are conflicts, you can merge and resolve them locally. Then push to your PR branch. Any changes to the branch will require a re-review.
- GitHub Actions will automatically test all authorized pull requests.
- Use GitHub to merge the PR once approved.

### Linking issues

If the pull request resolves an open issue, and you want GitHub to close the issue automatically after the PR is merged into the default branch, you can use the syntax `KEYWORD #ISSUE-NUMBER` like this:

```
close #123
```

If you notice any bugs in the live website, please create a [new issue](https://github.com/FuelLabs/docs-hub/issues/new) on GitHub with:
