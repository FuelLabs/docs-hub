# Versions

There are two version set of the docs available in the `docs-hub`: the default versions that are compatible with the `latest` toolchain and testnet, and the `nightly` versions, which reflect the latest releases on GitHub. 

## Updating the Nightly Versions

There is a Github action that runs every Monday and Thursday to update the `nightly` versions of the docs.

You can also update the nightly versions locally by running the command below:

```sh
TODO
```

The `nightly` versions should be kept at the latest release on GitHub for each tool.

## Updating the Default Versions

To change the versions for the books, update the config file and run this command:

```sh
TODO
```

The Sway & `forc` versions should match what is on the `latest`  toolchain.

The version of the wallet SDK should match the version of the Fuel Wallet extension.

The version of the Rust SDK should be the latest release that is compatible with the default version of `forc`.

The version of the TypeScript SDK should be the latest release that is compatible with the default version of `forc` and the Fuel wallet.

The version of the GraphQL API and Specs books should reflect the version of `fuel-core` used in the latest testnet.
