# Smart Contract Quickstart

Getting started with Fuel as a smart contract developer is as simple as:

1. [Installing](#installation) `fuelup`
2. [Generating a counter contract](#generating-a-counter-contract)
3. [Building and deploying the contract](#building-and-deploying-the-contract)

## Installation

### Testnet toolchain

To use the `testnet` toolchain, run the commands below:

```sh
fuelup self update
fuelup toolchain install testnet
fuelup default testnet
```

## Generating a counter contract

Run the command below to generate a counter contract in Sway:

```sh
forc template --template-name counter counter-contract
```

The contract will be in the `src/main.sw` file.

## Building and deploying the contract

To build a contract, move inside the `counter-contract` folder:

```sh
cd counter-contract
```

Next, run the `forc build` command:

```sh
forc build
```

To deploy the contract to the testnet, you can run:

```sh
forc deploy --testnet
```
