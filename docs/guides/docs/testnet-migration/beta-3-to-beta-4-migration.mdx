# Beta 4 Migration

This guide focuses on the transition from the end of tool support for `beta 3` to the start of `beta 4`.

> The team is constantly building. For updates on breaking changes beyond this guide, please refer to our bi-weekly report on [GitHub](https://github.com/FuelLabs/breaking-change-log/tree/master) or check announcements in our [forum](https://forum.fuel.network/c/announcements/7).

- [Fuelup v0.19.5](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuelup/releases/tag/v0.19.5)
- [Sway v0.45.0](https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway/releases/tag/v0.45.0)
- [TS SDK v0.57.0](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuels-ts/releases/tag/v0.57.0)
- [Rust SDK v0.47.0](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuels-rs/releases/tag/v0.47.0)
- [Wallet SDK v0.12.3](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuels-wallet/releases/tag/v0.12.3)

## Fuelup Toolchain

Update to the latest version of `fuelup`:

```sh
fuelup self update
```

Install the `beta-4` toolchain:

```sh
fuelup toolchain install beta-4
```

Set the `beta-4` toolchain as your default:

```sh
fuelup default beta-4
```

You will get this output if everything went as intended:

```sh
default toolchain set to 'beta-4-aarch64-apple-darwin'
```

## Wallet

Fuel Wallet version `0.11.0` is not compatible with beta 4. For compatibility with beta-4, please download the non-backwards compatible Fuel Wallet version `0.12.3`.

```sh
pnpm install @fuel-wallet@0.12.3
```

We have already submitted the beta-4 compatible version to the Chrome Web Store, and it is currently under review. Once your users update to this version, they will no longer be able to interact with the contracts you currently have deployed on the beta-3 testnet.

Please follow the instructions provided below:

1. Download [FuelWallet zip file](https://next-wallet.fuel.network/app/fuel-wallet.zip)
2. Inside Chrome or Brave;
3. Open the extensions page; it can be done by:
    - Clicking on settings -> extensions or;
4. Accessing brave://extensions/ or chrome://extensions/.
5. Enable the "Developer mode" switch on the top right
6. Load fuel-wallet.zip by:
    - Dragging your downloaded Fuel wallet file and dropping it in the extensions page or;
    - Clicking on Load unpacked and selecting the file.
7. If all goes right, an onboarding page will instantly open.

## Sway 

Integer types no longer implicitly cast to each other. Here are some examples of the changes:

```sway
// BEFORE - BETA 3
let y1: u16 = 4u8

// AFTER - BETA 4
let y1: u16 = 4u8.as_u16()
```

```sway
// BEFORE - BETA 3
let y3: u16 = 4u32

// AFTER - BETA 4
let y3: u16 = 4u32.try_as_u16().unwrap()
```

The standard library introduced `read()`, `write()`, and `try_read()` methods to contract storage. Use `try_read()` when possible to avoid potential issues with accessing uninitialized storage:

```sway
// BEFORE - BETA 3
let owner = storage.owner;

// AFTER - BETA 4
let owner = storage.owner.try_read().unwrap();
```

```sway
// BEFORE - BETA 3
storage.item_counter += 1;

// AFTER - BETA 4
storage.item_counter.write(storage.item_counter.read() + 1);
```

Function signatures in the standard library have changed:

```sway
// BEFORE - BETA 3
mint_to(amount, recipient);

// AFTER - BETA 4
mint_to(recipient, ZERO_B256, 1_000_000_000);
```

```sway
// BEFORE - BETA 3
transfer(amount, asset_id, recipient);

// AFTER - BETA 4
transfer(recipient, asset_id, amount);
```

Multi-token support, akin to Ethereum's ERC-1155, has now been natively introduced. This advancement enables the creation and destruction of unique subsidiary tokens within a single contract. These modifications will be incorporated into the standard library as `std::token`. Actions involving `burning` and `minting` now necessitate the `sub_id` of the token. Function signatures in the standard library have changed:

```sway
pub fn construct_asset_id(contract_id: ContractId, sub_id: SubId) -> AssetId {
    sha256((contract_id, sub_id))
}
```

Additionally, `AssetId` doesn't equate to `ContractId`. Instead, it's calculated in alignment with the aforementioned changes:

```sway
// BEFORE - BETA 3
IncorrectAssetId: ContractId;

// AFTER - BETA 4
IncorrectAssetId: AssetId;
```

Changes `disable_panic_on_overflow()` function to return the flags set
prior to calling the function:

```sway
// BEFORE - BETA 3
pub fn disable_panic_on_overflow() 

// AFTER - BETA 4
pub fn disable_panic_on_overflow() -> u64
```

## TS SDK

The `rawPayload` property has been deprecated from the `Receipt` struct.

For more details on the schema modification, please refer to the schema [here](https://graphql-docs.fuel.network/docs/reference/objects/#receipt).

```typescript
// BEFORE - BETA 3
const receipt = new ReceiptCoder().decode(arrayify(gqlReceipt.rawPayload), 0)[0];

// AFTER - BETA 4
const receipt = assembleReceiptByType(gqlReceipt);
```

The `.simulate()` method replacing `.get()` is tailored for read-only calls and testing potential blockchain changes without committing them, while `.call()` should be used for actions that modify the blockchain's state, keeping in mind that state-altering methods using `.call()` will consume resources.

```typescript
// BEFORE - BETA 3
let { value } = await contract.functions.get_count().get();

// AFTER - BETA 4
let { value } = await contract.functions.get_count().simulate();
```

The `addResourceInputsAndOutputs` function has been renamed to `addResources`, streamlining its name.

```typescript
// BEFORE - BETA 3
request.addResourceInputsAndOutputs(resources);

// AFTER - BETA 4
request.addResources(resources);
```

Similarly, `addPredicateResourcesInputsAndOutputs` is now more concisely known as `addPredicateResources`.
The reason we have a distinct method for adding predicate resources is that the creation of predicate inputs mandates the presence of both the predicate’s bytes and data bytes. 
With these methods, there’s no longer a need to manually create and set up an instance of a `ScriptTransactionRequest`, simplifying the process further.

```typescript
// BEFORE - BETA 3
const predicateInputs: TransactionRequestInput[] = predicateUtxos.map((utxo) => ({
  id: utxo.id,
  type: InputType.Coin,
  amount: utxo.amount,
  assetId: utxo.assetId,
  owner: utxo.owner.toB256(),
  txPointer: '0x00000000000000000000000000000000',
  witnessIndex: 0,
  maturity: 0,
  predicate: predicate.bytes,
  predicateData: predicate.predicateData,
}));

// AFTER - BETA 4
request.addPredicateResources(predicateUtxos, predicate.bytes, predicate.predicateData)
```

## Rust SDK

When providing contract IDs or addresses to contract functions, `.into()` is not longer needed:

```rust
// BEFORE - BETA 3
let response = contract_methods
    .transfer_coins_to_output(1_000_000, contract_id.into(), address.into())
    .append_variable_outputs(1)
    .call()
    .await?;

// AFTER - BETA 4
let response = contract_methods
    .transfer_coins_to_output(1_000_000, contract_id, address)
    .append_variable_outputs(1)
    .call()
    .await?;
```

`setup_contract_test` has been changed to `setup_program_test`. 

The command to generate bindings with Abigen has been modified; previously, it was `Abigen(name="...")`, but now it requires the program type and should be written as `Abigen(Program_Type(name="..."))`:

```rust
// BEFORE - BETA 3
setup_contract_test!(
    Wallets("wallet"),
    Abigen(name="MyContract", abi="some_folder")
);

// AFTER - BETA 4
setup_program_test!(
    Wallets("wallet"),
    Abigen(Contract(name = "MyContract", project = "some_folder")
        // Other Program Types 
        // Abigen(Script(name = "MyScript", project = "some_folder"))
        // Abigen(Predicate(name = "MyPredicate", project = "some_folder"))
    )
);
```

Now supporting String types, there have been slight modifications if you directly use ParamTypes:

```rust
// BEFORE - BETA 3
ParamType::String(len) => Self::decode_string_array(bytes, *len),

ParamType::StdString => Self::decode_std_string(bytes),

// AFTER - BETA 4
ParamType::StringArray(len) => Self::decode_string_array(bytes, *len),

ParamType::String => Self::decode_std_string(bytes),
```

Contract deployment no longer takes contract binary and deploy configurations as a parameter but is instead loaded in:

```rust
// BEFORE - BETA 3
let id = Contract::deploy(
    "./out/debug/contract.bin",
    &wallet,
    DeployConfiguration::default(),
)
.await?;

// AFTER - BETA 4
let storage_config =
StorageConfiguration::load_from("out/debug/contract-storage_slots.json").unwrap();

let load_config = LoadConfiguration::default().set_storage_configuration(storage_config);

let id = Contract::load_from(
    "./out/debug/contract.bin", load_config
)?
.deploy(&wallet, TxParameters::default())
.await?;
```

Now, `send_transaction(&tx)` immediately returns the transaction ID, which is used to retrieve the receipts:

```rust
// BEFORE - BETA 3
let receipts = self.try_provider()?.send_transaction(&tx).await?;

// AFTER - BETA 4
let tx_id = self.try_provider()?.send_transaction(&tx).await?;
let receipts = provider.get_receipts(&tx_id).await?;
```

The `produce_blocks` function has been updated to no longer need time parameters:

```rust
// BEFORE - BETA 3
provider
    .produce_blocks(100, Some(Utc.timestamp_opt(100, 0).unwrap()))
    .await?;

// AFTER - BETA 4
provider
    .produce_blocks(blocks_to_produce.into(), None)
```

`AssetId` and `ContractId` are no longer under the `tx` package and has since been moved to the `prelude`:

```rust
// BEFORE - BETA 3
use fuels::{prelude::*, tx::AssetId, tx::ContractId};

// AFTER - BETA 4
use fuels::{prelude::*}
```

Default parameter functions now start with `with_*` instead of `set_*`:

```rust
/* BEFORE - BETA 3 */
let call_params = CallParameters::default().set_storage_configuration(price);

let call_params = CallParameters::default().set_amount(price);

/* AFTER - BETA 4 */
let call_params = CallParameters::default().with_storage_configuration(price);

let call_params = CallParameters::default().with_amount(price);
```
