# Testing the predicate

Let's jump back into our MultiSig project again!

```sh
cd ../../multisig-predicate/predicate
```

## Generating a Test Template in Rust

Again follow these steps with `cargo-generate` in the predicate project directory like we did previously:

1. Install `cargo-generate`:

```bash
cargo install cargo-generate --locked
```

{/*markdownlint-disable*/}
2. Generate the template:
{/*markdownlint-disable*/}

<TestAction
id="cargo-generate-test"
action={{
  name: 'runCommand',
  commandFolder: 'guides-testing/multisig-predicate/predicate/'
}}
/>

```bash
cargo generate --init fuellabs/sway templates/sway-test-rs --name sway-store
```

{/*markdownlint-disable*/}
3. Update the Cargo.toml file
{/*markdownlint-disable*/}

<TestAction
id="temp-update-cargo-toml-file"
action={{
  name: 'writeToFile',
  filepath: 'guides-testing/multisig-predicate/predicate/Cargo.toml'
}}
/>

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/intro-to-predicates/multisig-predicate/Cargo.toml"
  lang="rust"
/>

## Imports

Delete the templated code and copy the following imports into your harness file. It's important to pay attention to two main imports: `predicates`, for obvious reasons, and the `ScriptTransactionBuilder`, which we'll use to create transactions. These transactions must be signed before being broadcasted to our local network.

<TestAction
id="multisig-predicate-test-imports"
action={{
  name: 'writeToFile',
  filepath: 'guides-testing/multisig-predicate/predicate/tests/harness.rs'
}}
/>

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/intro-to-predicates/multisig-predicate/tests/harness.rs"
  comment="imports"
  commentType="//"
  lang="rust"
/>

Similar to Rust testing for contracts, we'll import the predicate ABI (Application Binary Interface) to interact with it. Ensure the name of your predicate matches the one you're working with.

<TestAction
id="multisig-predicate-test-abi"
action={{
  name: 'modifyFile',
  filepath: 'guides-testing/multisig-predicate/predicate/tests/harness.rs'
}}
/>

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/intro-to-predicates/multisig-predicate/tests/harness.rs"
  comment="predicate_abi"
  commentType="//"
  lang="rust"
/>

## Setup

If you're familiar with Rust testing for Sway projects, much of the setup will be similar. Copy and paste the `setup_wallets_and_network` function into your harness file.

<TestAction
id="multisig-predicate-test-setup"
action={{
  name: 'modifyFile',
  filepath: 'guides-testing/multisig-predicate/predicate/tests/harness.rs'
}}
/>

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/intro-to-predicates/multisig-predicate/tests/harness.rs"
  comment="setup"
  commentType="//"
  lang="rust"
/>

The three key setup steps include:

1. Configuring the wallets that will act as owners of our multisig, through the configurables you'll see later in the tests.

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/intro-to-predicates/multisig-predicate/tests/harness.rs"
  comment="wallet_setup"
  commentType="//"
  lang="rust"
/>

{/*markdownlint-disable*/}
2. Setting up the default token (zeroth address) and loading some tokens into each wallet.
{/*markdownlint-disable*/}

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/intro-to-predicates/multisig-predicate/tests/harness.rs"
  comment="token_setup"
  commentType="//"
  lang="rust"
/>

{/*markdownlint-disable*/}
3. Preparing the network to broadcast our transaction, enabling us to successfully unlock the tokens from the predicate later.
{/*markdownlint-disable*/}

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/intro-to-predicates/multisig-predicate/tests/harness.rs"
  comment="network_setup"
  commentType="//"
  lang="rust"
/>

Since the predicate address is deterministic, we don't need to copy it as we do with smart contracts, which are deployed with a different address each time. We can leverage SDKs to build the predicate, ensuring we're working with the correct address without error!

{/*markdownlint-disable*/}
4. Gas isn't just used by the script itself; you also pay for the size of the transaction, signature checks, VM initialization, etc. These costs do not count towards the script gas so it might be hidden.
{/*markdownlint-disable*/}

## Test Cases

### Valid 2 of 3 signatures

Now, let's review the sequence of actions we'll take to simulate a real-world scenario, copy and paste the first test below and let's break it down step by step:

<TestAction
id="multisig-predicate-test-valid-two-of-three"
action={{
  name: 'modifyFile',
  filepath: 'guides-testing/multisig-predicate/predicate/tests/harness.rs'
}}
/>

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/intro-to-predicates/multisig-predicate/tests/harness.rs"
  comment="ordered_two_signatures"
  commentType="//"
  lang="rust"
/>

1. A group or individuals create their multisig by specifying the wallets that will safeguard the funds.
2. Funding the predicate.
3. Extracting the tokens when needed by building a transaction and getting the original wallets to sign it.
4. Broadcasting the transaction to unlock the funds from the predicate.

For step 1, as mentioned earlier, when we configure the number of required signatures (up to 3) and the 3 addresses that will safeguard our funds. Importing the ABI will automatically load a `PredicateNameConfigurable` type. In our case, that will be `MultiSigConfigurables`. There will be a corresponding with_configurable function to help you load each configurable. In our case, `with_REQUIRED_SIGNATURES` and `with_SIGNERS` are both loaded in!

How convenient!

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/intro-to-predicates/multisig-predicate/tests/harness.rs"
  comment="configurables"
  commentType="//"
  lang="rust"
/>

Next, we'll load our original predicate binary with our new configurables to generate our personalized predicate instance. Simply input your configurables using the `with_configurables` function, and this will give us a unique predicate root based on our inputs.

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/intro-to-predicates/multisig-predicate/tests/harness.rs"
  comment="predicate_test"
  commentType="//"
  lang="rust"
/>

For step 2, transferring funds to our newly generated predicate root is as straightforward as any other blockchain transfer.

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/intro-to-predicates/multisig-predicate/tests/harness.rs"
  comment="fund_predicate"
  commentType="//"
  lang="rust"
/>

In step 3, when the multisig holders decide to use the locked funds, we build a transaction specifying the inputs and outputs. Pay close attention to the outputs; we need to specify where the tokens from the predicate are going, which native asset they involve, and the amount. We're essentially extracting a portion of the original base asset sent into the predicate.

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/intro-to-predicates/multisig-predicate/tests/harness.rs"
  comment="transaction_building"
  commentType="//"
  lang="rust"
/>

The correct wallet addresses configured in the configurables must sign the transactions. This information, loaded as witness data, will evaluate our predicate to true. It's crucial to provide enough correct, unique signatures; otherwise, the transaction will fail, as demonstrated in later tests. Since our test only requires 2 signatures, we need to provide just those.

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/intro-to-predicates/multisig-predicate/tests/harness.rs"
  comment="sign_transaction"
  commentType="//"
  lang="rust"
/>

After the evaluation is correctly done, all we need to do is broadcast the transaction, and the requested funds should return to wallet 1.

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/intro-to-predicates/multisig-predicate/tests/harness.rs"
  comment="broadcast_transaction"
  commentType="//"
  lang="rust"
/>

### Valid unordered 3 of 3 signatures

The setup for the second test, `multisig_mixed_three_of_three`, follows the same scheme, showcasing that the transaction signing can be done in any order by valid wallets.

<TestAction
id="multisig-predicate-test-valid-3-of-3"
action={{
  name: 'modifyFile',
  filepath: 'guides-testing/multisig-predicate/predicate/tests/harness.rs'
}}
/>

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/intro-to-predicates/multisig-predicate/tests/harness.rs"
  comment="unordered_three_signatures"
  commentType="//"
  lang="rust"
/>

### Insufficient valid Signatures

The same principle applies to the third test, `multisig_not_enough_signatures_fails`, where the transaction will fail if there aren't enough signatures.

<TestAction
id="multisig-predicate-test-insufficient-1-of-3"
action={{
  name: 'modifyFile',
  filepath: 'guides-testing/multisig-predicate/predicate/tests/harness.rs'
}}
/>

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/intro-to-predicates/multisig-predicate/tests/harness.rs"
  comment="not_enough_signatures"
  commentType="//"
  lang="rust"
/>

## Checkpoint

If you have followed the previous steps correctly, your `harness.rs` test file should look like this:

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/intro-to-predicates/multisig-predicate/tests/harness.rs"
  comment="all"
  commentType="//"
  lang="rust"
/>

## Running the Tests

To run the test located in `tests/harness.rs`, use:

<TestAction
id="cargo-test"
action={{
  name: 'runCommand',
  commandFolder: 'guides-testing/multisig-predicate/predicate/'
}}
/>

```sh
cargo test
```

If you want to print outputs to the console during tests, use the `nocapture` flag:

```sh
cargo test -- --nocapture
```

Congratulations on making it this far! We've confirmed that our Multisig works.

Predicates aren't meant to be intimidating. State-minimized DeFi applications should be the standard, rather than resorting to gas golfing or writing assembly code for these optimizations. Now that you have predicates in your toolbox, go out and explore what other state-minimized DeFi applications you can build!
