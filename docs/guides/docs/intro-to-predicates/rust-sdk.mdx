# Testing the predicate

Let's jump back into our MultiSig project again!

```sh
cd ../../multisig-predicate/predicate
```

## Generating a Test Template in Rust

Again follow these steps with `cargo-generate` in the predicate project directory like we did previously:

1. Install `cargo-generate`:

```bash
cargo install cargo-generate --locked
```

{/*markdownlint-disable*/}
2. Generate the template:
{/*markdownlint-disable*/}

<TestAction
id="cargo-generate-test"
action={{
  name: 'runCommand',
  commandFolder: 'guides-testing/fuel-project/contract'
}}
/>

```bash
cargo generate --init fuellabs/sway templates/sway-test-rs --name sway-store
```

## Checkpoint

If you have followed the previous steps correctly, your `harness.rs` test file should look like this:

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/intro-to-predicates/predicate/tests/harness.rs"
  comment="all"
  commentType="//"
  lang="rust"
/>

## Running the Tests

To run the test located in `tests/harness.rs`, use:

<TestAction
id="cargo-test"
action={{
  name: 'runCommand',
  commandFolder: 'guides-testing/fuel-project/contract'
}}
/>

```sh
cargo test
```

If you want to print outputs to the console during tests, use the `nocapture` flag:

```sh
cargo test -- --nocapture
```
