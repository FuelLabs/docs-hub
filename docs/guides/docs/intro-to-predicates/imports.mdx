# Imports

The predicate keyword is used to identify that the program is a predicate.

<TestAction
id="sway-program-type"
action={{
  name: 'writeToFile',
  filepath: 'guides-testing/multisig-predicate/predicate/src/main.sw'
}}
/>

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/intro-to-predicates/predicate/src/main.sw"
  comment="predicate"
  commentType="//"
  lang="sway"
/>

We're going to utilize the [Sway standard library](https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway/tree/master/sway-lib-std) in our predicate. Delete the template code except for the predicate keyword and copy in the imports below:

<TestAction
id="sway-import"
action={{
  name: 'modifyFile',
  filepath: 'guides-testing/multisig-predicate/predicate/src/main.sw'
}}
/>

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/intro-to-predicates/predicate/src/main.sw"
  comment="import_parent"
  commentType="//"
  lang="sway"
/>

## Transactions

To construct the MultiSig, it's essential for us to obtain three specific components from the transaction through the standard library:

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/intro-to-predicates/predicate/src/main.sw"
  comment="import_tx"
  commentType="//"
  lang="sway"
/>

1. Transaction Witness Data: We'll use this to attach signatures on the transaction.
2. Transaction Witness Count: This will help us determine the number of signatures attached.
3. Transaction ID: The hash of the transaction.

## Constants

From the constants library, we'll be using `ZERO_B256` as a placeholder.

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/intro-to-predicates/predicate/src/main.sw"
  comment="import_zero_b256"
  commentType="//"
  lang="sway"
/>

## Signatures

We'll need `b512` because signatures are of type `b512`.

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/intro-to-predicates/predicate/src/main.sw"
  comment="import_b512"
  commentType="//"
  lang="sway"
/>

## Elliptical Curve

Lastly, we will be using `ec_recover_address`, short for elliptical curve recovery address. It's a function that allows us to cryptographically recover the address that signed a piece of data:

```rust
signing_address = ec_recover_address(signed_data, original_data)
```

This step is crucial for safeguarding the funds and ensuring that only the correct wallets can provide the necessary signatures.

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/intro-to-predicates/predicate/src/main.sw"
  comment="import_ecr"
  commentType="//"
  lang="sway"
/>
