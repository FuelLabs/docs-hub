# Testing the contract

## Generating a Test Template in Rust

To create your own test template using Rust, follow these steps with `cargo-generate` in the contract project directory:

1. Install `cargo-generate`:

```bash
cargo install cargo-generate --locked
```

{/*markdownlint-disable*/}
2. Generate the template:
{/*markdownlint-disable*/}

<TestAction
id="cargo-generate-test"
action={{
  name: 'runCommand',
  commandFolder: 'guides-testing/sway-store/sway-programs/contract'
}}
/>

```bash
cargo generate --init fuellabs/sway templates/sway-test-rs --name sway-store
```

{/*markdownlint-disable*/}
3. Update the Cargo.toml file
{/*markdownlint-disable*/}

<TestAction
id="temp-update-cargo-toml-file"
action={{
  name: 'writeToFile',
  filepath: 'guides-testing/sway-store/sway-programs/contract/Cargo.toml'
}}
/>

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/intro-to-sway/sway-store/sway-programs/contract/Cargo.toml"
  lang="rust"
/>

## Imports

We will be changing the existing `harness.rs` test file that has been generated. Firstly we need to change the imports. By importing the Fuel Rust SDK you will get majority of the functionalities housed within the prelude.

<TestAction
id="harness-import"
action={{
  name: 'writeToFile',
  filepath: 'guides-testing/sway-store/sway-programs/contract/tests/harness.rs'
}}
/>

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/intro-to-sway/sway-store/sway-programs/contract/tests/harness.rs"
  comment="rs_import"
  commentType="//"
  lang="rust"
/>

Always compile your contracts after making any changes. This ensures you're working with the most recent `contract-abi` that gets generated.

Update your contract name and ABI path in the `abigen` macro to match the name of your contract:

<TestAction
id="harness-abi"
action={{
  name: 'modifyFile',
  filepath: 'guides-testing/sway-store/sway-programs/contract/tests/harness.rs'
}}
/>

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/intro-to-sway/sway-store/sway-programs/contract/tests/harness.rs"
  comment="rs_abi"
  commentType="//"
  lang="rust"
/>

## Initializing Functions

When writing tests for Sway, two crucial objects are required: the contract instance and the wallets that interact with it. This helper function ensures a fresh start for every new test case so copy this into your test file. It will export the deployed contracts, the contract ID, and all the generated wallets for this purpose.

Replace the `get_contract_instance` function in your test harness with the function below:

<TestAction
id="harness-instance"
action={{
  name: 'modifyFile',
  filepath: 'guides-testing/sway-store/sway-programs/contract/tests/harness.rs'
}}
/>

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/intro-to-sway/sway-store/sway-programs/contract/tests/harness.rs"
  comment="rs_contract_instance_parent"
  commentType="//"
  lang="rust"
/>

## Test Cases

Given the immutable nature of smart contracts, it's important to cover all potential edge cases in your tests.
Let's delete the example `can_get_contract_id` test case and start writing some test cases at the bottom of our `harness.rs` file.

### Setting Owner

For this test case, we use the contract instance and use the SDK's `.with_account()` method. This lets us impersonate the first wallet. To check if the owner has been set correctly, we can see if the address given by the contract matches wallet 1's address. If you want to dig deeper, looking into the contract storage will show if wallet 1's address is stored properly.

<TestAction
id="harness-test-set-owner"
action={{
  name: 'modifyFile',
  filepath: 'guides-testing/sway-store/sway-programs/contract/tests/harness.rs'
}}
/>

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/intro-to-sway/sway-store/sway-programs/contract/tests/harness.rs"
  comment="rs_test_set_owner"
  commentType="//"
  lang="rust"
/>

### Setting Owner Once

An edge case we need to be vigilant about is an attempt to set the owner twice. We certainly don't want unauthorized ownership transfer of our contract! To address this, we've included the following line in our Sway contract: `require(owner.is_none(), "owner already initialized");`
This ensures the owner can only be set when it hasn't been previously established. To test this, we create a new contract instance: initially, we set the owner using wallet 1. Any subsequent attempt to set the owner with wallet 2 should be unsuccessful.

<TestAction
id="harness-test-set-owner-once"
action={{
  name: 'modifyFile',
  filepath: 'guides-testing/sway-store/sway-programs/contract/tests/harness.rs'
}}
/>

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/intro-to-sway/sway-store/sway-programs/contract/tests/harness.rs"
  comment="rs_test_set_owner_once"
  commentType="//"
  lang="rust"
/>

### Buying and Selling in the Marketplace

It's essential to test the basic functionalities of a smart contract to ensure its proper operation.
For this test, we have two wallets set up:

1. The first wallet initiates a transaction to list an item for sale. This is done by calling the `.list_item()` method, specifying both the price and details of the item they're selling.
2. The second wallet proceeds to purchase the listed item using the `.buy_item()` method, providing the index of the item they intend to buy.

Following these transactions, we'll assess the balances of both wallets to confirm the successful execution of the transactions.

<TestAction
id="harness-test-buy-sell"
action={{
  name: 'modifyFile',
  filepath: 'guides-testing/sway-store/sway-programs/contract/tests/harness.rs'
}}
/>

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/intro-to-sway/sway-store/sway-programs/contract/tests/harness.rs"
  comment="rs_test_list_and_buy_item"
  commentType="//"
  lang="rust"
/>

### Withdraw Owner Fees

Most importantly, as the creator of the marketplace, you need to ensure you're compensated. Similar to the previous tests, we'll invoke the relevant functions to make an exchange. This time, we'll verify if you can extract the difference in funds.

<TestAction
id="harness-test-owner-withdraw"
action={{
  name: 'modifyFile',
  filepath: 'guides-testing/sway-store/sway-programs/contract/tests/harness.rs'
}}
/>

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/intro-to-sway/sway-store/sway-programs/contract/tests/harness.rs"
  comment="rs_test_withdraw_funds"
  commentType="//"
  lang="rust"
/>

## Checkpoint

If you have followed the previous steps correctly your `harness.rs` test file should look like this:

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/intro-to-sway/sway-store/sway-programs/contract/tests/harness.rs"
  comment="all"
  commentType="//"
  lang="rust"
/>

## Running the Tests

{/*markdownlint-disable*/}
Update the shared fuel-toolchain.toml file
{/*markdownlint-disable*/}

<TestAction
id="temp-update-fuel-toolchain-toml-file"
action={{
  name: 'writeToFile',
  filepath: 'guides-testing/sway-store/fuel-toolchain.toml'
}}
/>

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/intro-to-sway/sway-store/fuel-toolchain.toml"
  lang="rust"
/>

To run the test located in `tests/harness.rs`, run the command below inside your `contract` folder:

<TestAction
id="cargo-test"
action={{
  name: 'runCommand',
  commandFolder: 'guides-testing/sway-store/sway-programs/contract'
}}
/>

```sh
cargo test
```

If you want to print outputs to the console during tests, use the `nocapture` flag:

```sh
cargo test -- --nocapture
```

Now that we're confident in the functionality of our smart contract, it's time to build a frontend. This will allow users to seamlessly interact with our new marketplace!
