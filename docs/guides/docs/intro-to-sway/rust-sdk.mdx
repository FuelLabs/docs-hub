# Testing the contract

## Generating a Test Template in Rust

To create your own test template using Rust, follow these steps with `cargo-generate` in the contract project directory:

1. Install `cargo-generate`:

```bash
cargo install cargo-generate
```

{/*markdownlint-disable*/}
2. Generate the template:
{/*markdownlint-disable*/}

<TestAction
id="cargo-generate-test"
action={{
  name: 'runCommand',
  commandFolder: 'guides-testing/fuel-project/contract'
}}
/>

```bash
cargo generate --init fuellabs/sway templates/sway-test-rs --name contract
```

For our test purposes, we will be using a different version than is used in this default template, so we need make a few small changes.

First, in your `Cargo.toml` file, change the `fuels` version from `"0.53.0"` to `"0.48.0"`.
Your `dev-dependencies` should look like this:

<TestAction
id="sdk-version"
action={{
  name: 'modifyFile',
  filepath: 'guides-testing/fuel-project/contract/Cargo.toml',
  atLine: 10,
  removeLines: [10],
  useSetData: 'fuels = { version = "0.48.0", features = ["fuel-core-lib"] }'
}}
/>

```toml
[dev-dependencies]
fuels = { version = "0.48.0", features = ["fuel-core-lib"] }
tokio = { version = "1.12", features = ["rt", "macros"] }
```

Next, in your `tests/harness.rs` file, change delete the `unwrap();` on line 21 and add a `;` to the end of `await` on line 20.
The `wallets` variable declaration should look like this:

<TestAction
id="modify-harness-wallets"
action={{
  name: 'modifyFile',
  filepath: 'guides-testing/fuel-project/contract/tests/harness.rs',
  atLine: 20,
  removeLines: [20, 21],
  useSetData: 'await;'
}}
/>

```rust
let mut wallets = launch_custom_provider_and_get_wallets(
        WalletsConfig::new(
            Some(1),             /* Single wallet */
            Some(1),             /* Single coin (UTXO) */
            Some(1_000_000_000), /* Amount per coin */
        ),
        None,
        None,
    )
    .await;
```

Finally, change `TxPolicies::default()` on line 29 to `TxParameters::default()`.
The `id` variable declaration should look like this:

<TestAction
id="modify-harness-id"
action={{
  name: 'modifyFile',
  filepath: 'guides-testing/fuel-project/contract/tests/harness.rs',
  atLine: 28,
  removeLines: [28],
  useSetData: '.deploy(&wallet, TxParameters::default())'
}}
/>

```rust
let id = Contract::load_from(
        "./out/debug/contract.bin",
        LoadConfiguration::default(),
    )
    .unwrap()
    .deploy(&wallet, TxParameters::default())
    .await
    .unwrap();
```

## Imports

We will be changing the existing `harness.rs` test file that has been generated. Firstly we need to change the imports. By importing the Fuel Rust SDK you will get majority of the functionalities housed within the prelude.

<TestAction
id="harness-import"
action={{
  name: 'writeToFile',
  filepath: 'guides-testing/fuel-project/contract/tests/harness.rs'
}}
/>

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/intro-to-sway/contract/tests/harness.rs"
  comment="rs_import"
  commentType="//"
  lang="rust"
/>

Always compile your contracts after making any changes. This ensures you're working with the most recent `contract-abi` that gets generated.

<TestAction
id="harness-abi"
action={{
  name: 'modifyFile',
  filepath: 'guides-testing/fuel-project/contract/tests/harness.rs'
}}
/>

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/intro-to-sway/contract/tests/harness.rs"
  comment="rs_abi"
  commentType="//"
  lang="rust"
/>

## Initializing Functions

When writing tests for Sway, two crucial objects are required: the contract instance and the wallets that interact with it. This helper function ensures a fresh start for every new test case so copy this into your test file. It will export the deployed contracts, the contract ID, and all the generated wallets for this purpose.

<TestAction
id="harness-instance"
action={{
  name: 'modifyFile',
  filepath: 'guides-testing/fuel-project/contract/tests/harness.rs'
}}
/>

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/intro-to-sway/contract/tests/harness.rs"
  comment="rs_contract_instance_parent"
  commentType="//"
  lang="rust"
/>

### Contract Storage and Binary

Besides the ABI, which outlines the interaction protocol with the smart contract, it's imperative to also load the contract's storage and binary. These three components are vital for the successful creation and deployment of the contract instance, guaranteeing precise testing in the following phases.

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/intro-to-sway/contract/tests/harness.rs"
  comment="rs_contract_instance_config"
  commentType="//"
  lang="rust"
/>

## Test Cases

Given the immutable nature of smart contracts, it's not only vital to test basic functionalities but also imperative to thoroughly cover all potential edge cases. Let's write the test cases at the bottom of our harness.rs file.

### Setting Owner

For this test case, we use the contract instance and use the SDK's `.with_account()` method. This lets us impersonate the first wallet. To check if the owner has been set correctly, we can see if the address given by the contract matches wallet 1's address. If you want to dig deeper, looking into the contract storage will show if wallet 1's address is stored properly.

<TestAction
id="harness-test-set-owner"
action={{
  name: 'modifyFile',
  filepath: 'guides-testing/fuel-project/contract/tests/harness.rs'
}}
/>

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/intro-to-sway/contract/tests/harness.rs"
  comment="rs_test_set_owner"
  commentType="//"
  lang="rust"
/>

### Setting Owner Once

An edge case we need to be vigilant about is an attempt to set the owner twice. We certainly don't want unauthorized ownership transfer of our contract! To address this, we've included the following line in our Sway contract: `require(owner.is_none(), "owner already initialized");`
This ensures the owner can only be set when it hasn't been previously established. To test this, we create a new contract instance: initially, we set the owner using wallet 1. Any subsequent attempt to set the owner with wallet 2 should be unsuccessful.

<TestAction
id="harness-test-set-owner-once"
action={{
  name: 'modifyFile',
  filepath: 'guides-testing/fuel-project/contract/tests/harness.rs'
}}
/>

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/intro-to-sway/contract/tests/harness.rs"
  comment="rs_test_set_owner_once"
  commentType="//"
  lang="rust"
/>

### Buying and Selling in the Marketplace

It's essential to test the basic functionalities of a smart contract to ensure its proper operation. For this test, we have two wallets set up:

1. The first wallet initiates a transaction to list an item for sale. This is done by calling the `.list_item()` method, specifying both the price and details of the item they're selling.
2. The second wallet proceeds to purchase the listed item using the `.buy_item()` method, providing the index of the item they intend to buy.

Following these transactions, we'll assess the balances of both wallets to confirm the successful execution of the transactions.

<TestAction
id="harness-test-buy-sell"
action={{
  name: 'modifyFile',
  filepath: 'guides-testing/fuel-project/contract/tests/harness.rs'
}}
/>

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/intro-to-sway/contract/tests/harness.rs"
  comment="rs_test_list_and_buy_item"
  commentType="//"
  lang="rust"
/>

### Withdraw Owner Fees

Most importantly, as the creator of the marketplace, you need to ensure you're compensated. Similar to the previous tests, we'll invoke the relevant functions to make an exchange. This time, we'll verify if you can extract the difference in funds.

<TestAction
id="harness-test-owner-withdraw"
action={{
  name: 'modifyFile',
  filepath: 'guides-testing/fuel-project/contract/tests/harness.rs'
}}
/>

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/intro-to-sway/contract/tests/harness.rs"
  comment="rs_test_withdraw_funds"
  commentType="//"
  lang="rust"
/>

## Running the Tests

To run the test located in `tests/harness.rs`, use:

<TestAction
id="cargo-test"
action={{
  name: 'runCommand',
  commandFolder: 'guides-testing/fuel-project/contract'
}}
/>

```bash
cargo test
```

If you wish to print outputs to the console during tests, execute:

```bash
cargo test -- --nocapture
```

Now that we're confident in the functionality of our smart contract, it's time to build a frontend. This will allow users to seamlessly interact with our new marketplace!
