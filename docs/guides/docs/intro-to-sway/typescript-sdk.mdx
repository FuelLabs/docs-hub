## Building the Frontend

### Setup

Initialize a new React app with TypeScript in the same parent folder as your contract using the command below.

```shell
npx create-react-app frontend --template typescript
```

Next, install the fuels Typescript and wallet SDKs in the frontend folder and generate types from your contract with `fuels typegen`.

```shell
cd frontend
npm install fuels @fuel-wallet/sdk
npx fuels typegen -i ../contract/out/debug/*-abi.json -o ./src/contracts
```

In the `tsconfig.json` file, add the line below in the `compilerOptions` object to add the Fuel wallet type on the window object.

```json
"types": ["@fuel-wallet/sdk"],
```

Open the `src/App.tsx` file, and replace the boilerplate code with the template below:

<CodeImport
  file="../../../intro-to-sway/frontend/src/App.tsx"
  comment="fe_app_template"
  commentType="//"
  lang="tsx"
/>

Finally, copy and paste the CSS code below in your `App.css` file to add some simple styling.

<CodeImport
  file="../../../intro-to-sway/frontend/src/App.css"
  comment="fe_css"
  commentType="//"
  lang="tsx"
/>

### Connecting to the contract

At the top of the file, add your contract ID as a constant.

<CodeImport
  file="../../../intro-to-sway/frontend/src/App.tsx"
  comment="fe_contract_id"
  commentType="//"
  lang="tsx"
/>

Next, create a new folder in the `src` folder called `hooks`, and copy and paste the `useFuel.tsx` and `useIsConnected.tsx` hooks from the example in this repo. You can also find them in the [offical wallet docs](https://wallet.fuel.network/docs/react/).

In `App.tsx`, import these hooks.

<CodeImport
  file="../../../intro-to-sway/frontend/src/App.tsx"
  comment="fe_import_hooks"
  commentType="//"
  lang="tsx"
/>

In the `App` function, we can call these hooks like this:

<CodeImport
  file="../../../intro-to-sway/frontend/src/App.tsx"
  comment="fe_call_hooks"
  commentType="//"
  lang="tsx"
/>

Now we can check if the user has the fuel wallet installed and check if it's connected. 

If the user doesn't have the `fuel` object in their window, we know that they don't have the Fuel wallet extention installed.
If they have it installed, we can then check if the wallet is connected.

<CodeImport
  file="../../../intro-to-sway/frontend/src/App.tsx"
  comment="fe_fuel_obj"
  commentType="{/*"
  lang="tsx"
/>

Next, let's add a state variable called `wallets` with the `useState` hook, which will have the type `WalletLocked`.

You can think of a locked wallet as a user wallet you can't sign transactions for, and an unlocked wallet as a wallet where you have the private key and are able to sign transactions.

<CodeImport
  file="../../../intro-to-sway/frontend/src/App.tsx"
  comment="fe_wallet"
  commentType="//"
  lang="tsx"
/>

Next, we can use the `useMemo` hook to connect to our contract with the connected wallet.

<CodeImport
  file="../../../intro-to-sway/frontend/src/App.tsx"
  comment="fe_use_memo"
  commentType="//"
  lang="tsx"
/>


Now we have our contract connection ready. You can console log the contract here to make sure this is working correctly.

### UI

In our app we're going to have two tabs: one to see all of the items listed for sale, and one to list a new item for sale.

Let's add another state variable called `active` that we can use to toggle between our tabs. We can set the default tab to show all listed items.

<CodeImport
  file="../../../intro-to-sway/frontend/src/App.tsx"
  comment="fe_state_active"
  commentType="//"
  lang="tsx"
/>

Below the header, add a nav section to toggle between the two options.

<CodeImport
  file="../../../intro-to-sway/frontend/src/App.tsx"
  comment="fe_ui_state_active"
  commentType="{/*"
  lang="tsx"
/>

Next we can create our components to show and list items.

### Listing an Item

Create a new folder in the `src` folder called `components`, and create a file there component called `ListItem.tsx`.

At the top of the file, import the `useState` hook from `react`, the generated contract ABI from the `contracts` folder, and `bn` (big number) type from `fuels`.

<CodeImport
  file="../../../intro-to-sway/frontend/src/components/ListItem.tsx"
  comment="fe_list_items_import"
  commentType="//"
  lang="tsx"
/>

This component will take the contract we made in `App.tsx` as a prop, so let's create an interface for the component.

<CodeImport
  file="../../../intro-to-sway/frontend/src/components/ListItem.tsx"
  comment="fe_list_items_interface"
  commentType="//"
  lang="tsx"
/>

We can set up the template for the function like this.

<CodeImport
  file="../../../intro-to-sway/frontend/src/components/ListItem.tsx"
  comment="fe_list_items_function"
  commentType="//"
  lang="tsx"
/>


To list an item, we'll create a form where the user can input the metadata string and price for the item they want to list. 
Let's start by adding some state variables for the `metadata` and `price`. We can also add a `status` variable to track the submit status.

<CodeImport
  file="../../../intro-to-sway/frontend/src/components/ListItem.tsx"
  comment="fe_list_items_state_variables"
  commentType="//"
  lang="tsx"
/>

Under the heading, add the code below for the form:

<CodeImport
  file="../../../intro-to-sway/frontend/src/components/ListItem.tsx"
  comment="fe_list_items_form"
  commentType="{/*"
  lang="tsx"
/>

Finally, we need to add the `handleSubmit` function. 
We can use the contract prop to call the `list_item` function and pass in the `price` and `metadata` from the form.

<CodeImport
  file="../../../intro-to-sway/frontend/src/components/ListItem.tsx"
  comment="fe_list_items_handle_submit"
  commentType="//"
  lang="tsx"
/>

Now that we have this component, let's add it to our `App.tsx` file and try it out.

Import the `ListItem` component at the top of the file.
Then, replace where it says `Connected!` with the code below:

<CodeImport
  file="../../../intro-to-sway/frontend/src/App.tsx"
  comment="fe_items_contract"
  commentType="{/*"
  lang="tsx"
/>

Now, try listing an item to make sure this works. 
You should see the message `Item successfully listed!`.

### Show All Items

Next, let's create a new file called `AllItems.tsx` in the `components` folder.

Copy and paste the template code below for this component:

<CodeImport
  file="../../../intro-to-sway/frontend/src/components/AllItems.tsx"
  comment="fe_all_items_template"
  commentType="//"
  lang="tsx"
/>

Here we can get the item count to see how many items are listed, and then loop through each of them to get the item details.

First, let's create some state variables to store the number of items listed, an array of the item details, and the loading status.

<CodeImport
  file="../../../intro-to-sway/frontend/src/components/AllItems.tsx"
  comment="fe_all_items_state_variables"
  commentType="//"
  lang="tsx"
/>

Next, let's fetch the items in a `useEffect` hook.
Because these are read-only functions, we can simulate a dry-run of the transaction by using the `get` method instead of `call` so the user doesn't have to sign anything.

<CodeImport
  file="../../../intro-to-sway/frontend/src/components/AllItems.tsx"
  comment="fe_all_items_use_effect"
  commentType="//"
  lang="tsx"
/>

If the item count is greater than `0` and we are able to successfully load the items, we can map through them and display an item card.

The item card will show the item details and a buy button to buy that item, so we'll need to pass the contract and the item as props.

<CodeImport
  file="../../../intro-to-sway/frontend/src/components/AllItems.tsx"
  comment="fe_all_items_cards"
  commentType="{/*"
  lang="tsx"
/>

### Item Card

Now let's create the item card component. 
Create a new file called `ItemCard.tsx` in the components folder, and copy and paste the template code below.

<CodeImport
  file="../../../intro-to-sway/frontend/src/components/ItemCard.tsx"
  comment="fe_item_card_template"
  commentType="//"
  lang="tsx"
/>

Add a `status` variable to track the status of the buy button.

<CodeImport
  file="../../../intro-to-sway/frontend/src/components/ItemCard.tsx"
  comment="fe_item_card_status"
  commentType="//"
  lang="tsx"
/>

Then add the item details and status messages to the card.

<CodeImport
  file="../../../intro-to-sway/frontend/src/components/ItemCard.tsx"
  comment="fe_item_cards"
  commentType="//"
  lang="tsx"
/>

Create a new async function called `handleBuyItem`.
Because this function is payable and transfers coins to the item owner, we'll need to do a couple special things here.

Whenever we call any function that uses the transfer or mint functions in Sway, we have to append the matching number of variable outputs to the call with the `txParams` method. Because the `buy_item` function just transfers assets to the item owner, the number of variable outputs is `1`.

Next, because this function is payable and the user needs to transfer the price of the item, we'll use the `callParams` method to forward the amount. With Fuel you can transfer any type of asset, so we need to specify both the amount and the asset ID.

<CodeImport
  file="../../../intro-to-sway/frontend/src/components/ItemCard.tsx"
  comment="fe_item_card_buy_item"
  commentType="//"
  lang="tsx"
/>

Go back to `AllItems.tsx` and import the `ItemCard` component we just made.

Now you should be able to see and buy all of the items listed in your contract.

### Checkpoint

Ensure that all your files are correctly configured by examining the code below. If you require additional assistance, refer to the repository [here](https://github.com/FuelLabs/intro-to-sway/tree/main/frontend)

`App.tsx`

<CodeImport
  file="../../../intro-to-sway/frontend/src/App.tsx"
  comment="fe_app_all"
  commentType="/*"
  lang="tsx"
/>

`AllItems.tsx`

<CodeImport
  file="../../../intro-to-sway/frontend/src/components/AllItems.tsx"
  comment="fe_all_items_all"
  commentType="/*"
  lang="tsx"
/>

`ItemCard.tsx`

<CodeImport
  file="../../../intro-to-sway/frontend/src/components/ItemCard.tsx"
  comment="fe_item_card_all"
  commentType="/*"
  lang="tsx"
/>

`ListItem.tsx`

<CodeImport
  file="../../../intro-to-sway/frontend/src/components/ListItem.tsx"
  comment="fe_list_item_all"
  commentType="/*"
  lang="tsx"
/>

And that's it for the frontend! You just created a whole dapp on Fuel!
