## Defining an Item Struct

Struct is short for structure, which is a data structure similar to an object in JavaScript. You define a struct with the `struct` keyword in Sway and define the fields of a struct inside curly brackets.

The core of our program is the ability to list, sell, and get `items`.

Let's define the Item type as shown below:

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/intro-to-sway/contract/src/main.sw"
  comment="struct"
  commentType="//"
  lang="sway"
/>

The item struct will contain an ID, price, the owner's identity, a string representing a URL or identifier for off-chain data about the item (such as its description and photos), and a "total bought" counter to track the overall number of purchases.

### Types

The `Item` struct uses three types: `u64`, `str`, and `Identity`.

`u64`: a 64-bit unsigned integer.

In Sway, there are four native types of numbers:
- `u8`: an 8-bit unsigned integer.
- `u16`: a 16-bit unsigned integer.
- `u32`: a 32-bit unsigned integer.
- `u64`: a 64-bit unsigned integer.
- `u256`: a 256-bit unsigned integer.

An unsigned integer means there is no `+` or `-` sign, making the value always positive. `u64` is the default type used for numbers in Sway.

In JavaScript, there are two types of integers: `number` and `BigInt`. The primary difference between these types is that `BigInt` can store much larger values. Similarly, each numeric type in Sway has its maximum value that can be stored.

`String Array`: a string is a built-in primitive type in Sway. The number inside the square brackets indicates the size of the string.

`Identity`: an enum type that represents either a user's `Address` or a `ContractId`. In Sway, a contract and an EOA (Externally Owned Account) are distinctly differentiated. Both are type-safe wrappers for `b256`.
