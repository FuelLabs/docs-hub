## Defining an Item Struct

Struct is short for structure, which is a data structure similar to an object in JavaScript. You define a struct with the `struct` keyword in Sway and define the fields of a struct inside curly brackets.

The core of our program is the ability to list, sell, and get `Items`.

Let's define the `Item` type as shown below:

```rust
struct Item {
    id: u64,
    price: u64,
    owner: Identity,
    metadata: String,
    total_bought: u64,
}
```

The item struct will hold an ID, price, the owner's identity, a string for a URL or identifier where off-chain data about the item is stored (such as the description and photos), and a total bought counter to keep track of the total number of purchases.

### Types

The `Item` struct uses three types: `u64`, `String`, and `Identity`.

`u64`: a 64-bit unsigned integer

In Sway, there are four native types of numbers:
- `u8`: an 8-bit unsigned integer
- `u16` a 16-bit unsigned integer
- `u32` a 32-bit unsigned integer
- `u64`: a 64-bit unsigned integer

An unsigned integer means there is no `+` or `-` sign, so the value is always positive. `u64` is the default type used for numbers in Sway. To use other number types, for example [`u256`](https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway/blob/master/sway-lib-std/src/u256.sw) or [signed integers](https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway-libs/tree/master/sway_libs/src/signed_integers), you must import them from a library.

In JavaScript, there are two types of integers: a number and a BigInt. The main difference between these types is that BigInt can store a much larger value. Similarly, each number type for Sway has different values for the largest number that can be stored.

`String`: a string with created from the string in the standard library. If you want to use the `str` keyword you must define a fixed length and cannot be changed. 

`Identity`: an enum type that represents either a user's `Address` or a `ContractId`. We already imported this type from the standard library earlier. To a contract or and EOA (Externally owned account) which are two clearly differentiated in Sway. Which are both just typesafe wrapped b256.
