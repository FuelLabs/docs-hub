## Prerequisites

Before diving into any Sway code, ensure you have installed the following dependencies.

Start by installing the [Fuel toolchain](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuelup).

Install the beta-4 toolchain distribution and set it as your default with:

```bash
$ fuelup toolchain install beta-4
$ fuelup default beta-4
```

You can check to see the current toolchain version installed by running the following:

```bash
$ fuelup show
```

Next, add the [Sway extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=FuelLabs.sway-vscode-plugin) to your VS Code.

If you want to be able to run tests in Rust, install the [Rust toolchain](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) as well.

> This example uses the `beta-4` toolchain, which is version `0.45.0` of `forc`

Within your terminal start by creating a new folder called `sway-store`, and making a new contract called `sway-store-contract`. 

```bash
$ forc new sway-store
$ cd sway-store
```

Open up the `contract` folder in VSCode, and inside the `src` folder you should see a file called `main.sw`. This is where you will write your Sway contract. 

Since we're creating a brand new contract you can delete everything in this file.
