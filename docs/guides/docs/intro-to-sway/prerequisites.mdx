# Prerequisites

## Installation

<TextImport

  comment="install_fuelup"
  commentType="{/*"
/>

<CodeImport
  file="../installation/index.mdx"
  comment="install_fuelup_command"
  commentType="{/*"
  lang="sh"
  trim="true"
/>

<TextImport
  file="../counter-dapp/building-a-smart-contract.mdx"
  comment="install_help"
  commentType="{/*"

### Already have `fuelup` installed?

<TextImport
  file="../counter-dapp/building-a-smart-contract.mdx"
  comment="already_installed"

### Fuel Wallet

<TextImport
  file="../counter-dapp/building-a-frontend.mdx"
  comment="install_wallet"
  commentType="{/*"

Additionally for this guide, ensure you're using Node.js/npm version {props.nodeVersion}.
You can check your Node.js version with:

```sh
node -v
```

## Project Setup

Start with a Fuel template and name it `sway-store`.

<TestAction
id="create-project-folder"
action={{
  name: 'runCommand',
  commandFolder: 'guides-testing'
}}
/>

```sh
pnpm create fuels --pnpm sway-store
```

Go into the `sway-store` folder:

```sh
cd sway-store
```

There should already be a folder called `sway-programs` inside, where your Sway programs will live. Ignore the other programs as we will only focus on the `contract` program type in this tutorial. Move into your `contract` folder:

```sh
cd sway-programs/contract
```

Open up the `contract` folder in VSCode, and inside the `src` folder you should see a file called `main.sw`. This is where you will write your Sway contract.

Since we're creating a brand new contract you can delete everything in this file except for the `contract` keyword.

<TestAction
id="sway-program-type"
action={{
  name: 'writeToFile',
  filepath: 'guides-testing/sway-store/sway-programs/contract/src/main.sw'
}}
/>

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/intro-to-sway/sway-store/sway-programs/contract/src/main.sw"
  comment="contract"
  commentType="//"
  lang="sway"
/>

The first line of the file is specifically reserved to inform the compiler whether we are writing a contract, script, predicate, or library. To designate the file as a contract, use the `contract` keyword.
