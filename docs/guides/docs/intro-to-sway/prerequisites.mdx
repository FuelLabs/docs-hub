## Prerequisites

Before diving into any Sway code, ensure you have properly followed the [installation guide](https://docs.fuel.network/guides/installation/).

> This example uses the `beta-4` toolchain, which is version `0.46.1` of `forc`

Within your terminal start by creating a new folder called `sway-store`, and making a new contract called `sway-store-contract`. 

```bash
$ forc new sway-store
$ cd sway-store
```

Open up the `contract` folder in VSCode, and inside the `src` folder you should see a file called `main.sw`. This is where you will write your Sway contract. 

Since we're creating a brand new contract you can delete everything in this file.
