Make sure you have the latest version of the [Fuel Wallet](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fuel-wallet/dldjpboieedgcmpkchcjcbijingjcgok) installed.

Additionally for this guide, ensure you're using Node.js/npm version {props.nodeVersion}.
You can check your Node.js version with:

```sh
node -v
```

## Project Setup

Start with a new empty folder and name it `fuel-project`.

<TestAction
id="create-project-folder"
action={{
  name: 'runCommand',
  commandFolder: 'guides-testing'
}}
/>

```sh
mkdir fuel-project
```

Go into the `fuel-project` folder:

```sh
cd fuel-project
```

Within your terminal start by creating a new Sway project called `contract`:

<TestAction
id="create-contract"
action={{
  name: 'runCommand',
  commandFolder: 'guides-testing/fuel-project'
}}
/>

```sh
forc new contract
```

Your project structure generated from the `forc` command should like this:

<TestAction
id="contract-tree"
action={{
  name: 'runCommand',
  commandFolder: 'guides-testing/fuel-project'
}}
/>

```sh
tree contract
```

```sh
contract
├── Forc.toml
└── src
    └── main.sw

1 directory, 2 files
```

Move into your contract folder:

```sh
cd contract
```

Open up the `contract` folder in VSCode, and inside the `src` folder you should see a file called `main.sw`. This is where you will write your Sway contract.

Since we're creating a brand new contract you can delete everything in this file except for the `contract` keyword.

<TestAction
id="sway-program-type"
action={{
  name: 'writeToFile',
  filepath: 'guides-testing/fuel-project/contract/src/main.sw'
}}
/>

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/intro-to-sway/contract/src/main.sw"
  comment="contract"
  commentType="//"
  lang="sway"
/>

The first line of the file is specifically reserved to inform the compiler whether we are writing a contract, script, predicate, or library. To designate the file as a contract, use the `contract` keyword.
