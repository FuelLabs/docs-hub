## Prerequisites

Before diving into any Sway code, ensure you have properly followed the [installation guide](https://docs.fuel.network/guides/installation/).

> This example uses the `beta-4` toolchain, which is version `0.46.1` of `forc`

Start with a new empty folder and name it `fuel-project`.

```sh
$ mkdir fuel-project
```

Go into the `fuel-project` folder:

```sh
$ cd fuel-project
```

Within your terminal start by creating a new sway project called `contract`:

```sh
$ forc new contract
```

Move into your contract folder:

```sh
$ cd contract
```

Open up the `contract` folder in VSCode, and inside the `src` folder you should see a file called `main.sw`. This is where you will write your Sway contract. 

Your project structure generated from the `forc` command should like this: 

```sh
$ tree contract
contract
├── Forc.toml
└── src
    └── main.sw
```

Since we're creating a brand new contract you can delete everything in this file except for the `contract` keyword.

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/intro-to-sway/contract/src/main.sw"
  comment="contract"
  commentType="//"
  lang="sway"
/>

The first line of the file is specifically reserved to inform the compiler whether we are writing a contract, script, predicate, or library. To designate the file as a contract, use the `contract` keyword.
