# Defining The Storage Block

Next, we'll introduce the storage block. This is where you store all persistent state variables in your contract.

Variables declared within a function and not saved in the storage block will be discarded once the function completes its execution. Add the storage block below to your `main.sw` file:

<TestAction
id="sway-storage"
action={{
  name: 'modifyFile',
  filepath: 'guides-testing/fuel-project/contract/src/main.sw'
}}
/>

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/intro-to-sway/contract/src/main.sw"
  comment="storage"
  commentType="//"
  lang="sway"
/>

The first variable we've stored is `item_counter`, a number initialized to 0. This counter can be used to track the total number of items listed.

### StorageMap

A `StorageMap` is a unique type that permits the saving of key-value pairs within a storage block.

To define a storage map, you need to specify the types for both the key and the value. For instance, in the example below, the key type is `u64`, and the value type is an `Item` struct.

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/intro-to-sway/contract/src/main.sw"
  comment="storage_map"
  commentType="//"
  lang="sway"
/>

Here, we are creating a mapping from the item's ID to the `Item` struct. Using this, we can retrieve information about an item using its ID.

### Options

Here, we are defining the `owner` variable as one that can either be `None` or hold an `Identity`.

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/intro-to-sway/contract/src/main.sw"
  comment="storage_option"
  commentType="//"
  lang="sway"
/>

If you want a value to be potentially null or undefined under specific conditions, you can employ the `Option` type. It's an enum that can take on either `Some(value)` or `None`. The keyword `None` indicates the absence of a value, while `Some` signifies the presence of a stored value.
