## Defining The Storage Block

Next, we'll introduce the storage block. This block is where you store state variables in your contract that need to be persistent. Any Sway primitive type can be placed in the storage block.

Variables declared within a function and not saved in the storage block will be discarded once the function completes its execution.

```sway
storage {
    // counter for total items listed
    item_counter: u64 = 0,
    // map of item IDs to Items
    item_map: StorageMap<u64, Item> = StorageMap {},
    // owner of the contract
    owner: Option<Identity> = Option::None,
}
```

The first variable we've stored is `item_counter`, a number initialized to 0. This counter can be used to track the total number of items listed.

### StorageMap

A `StorageMap` is a unique type that permits the saving of key-value pairs within a storage block.

To define a storage map, you need to specify the types for both the key and the value. For instance, in the example below, the key type is `u64`, and the value type is an `Item` struct.

```sway
item_map: StorageMap<u64, Item> = StorageMap{}
```

Here, we are creating a mapping from the item's ID to the `Item` struct. Using this, we can retrieve information about an item using its ID.

### Options

Here, we are defining the `owner` variable as one that can either be `None` or hold an `Identity`.

```sway
owner: Option<Identity> = Option::None
```

If you want a value to be potentially null or undefined under specific conditions, you can employ the `Option` type. It's an enum that can take on either `Some(value)` or `None`. The keyword `None` indicates the absence of a value, while `Some` signifies the presence of a stored value.
