## Writing a Contract

The first line of the file is specially reserved to let the compiler know if we are writing a contract, script, predicate, or library. To define the file as a contract, use the `contract` keyword.

```rust
contract;
```

### Imports

The Sway standard library provides several utility types and methods we can use in our contract. To import a library, you can use the `use` keyword and `::`, also called a namespace qualifier, to chain library names like this:

```rust
// imports the msg_sender function from the std library
use std::auth::msg_sender;
```

You can also group together imports using curly brackets:

```rust
use std::{
    auth::msg_sender,
    storage::StorageVec,
}
```

For this contract, here is what needs to be imported:

```rust
use std::{
    auth::msg_sender,
    call_frames::msg_asset_id,
    constants::BASE_ASSET_ID,
    context::{
        msg_amount,
        this_balance,
    },
    token::transfer,
};
```

We'll go through what each of these imports does as we use them later.
