## Defining the Program Type

The first line of the file is specifically reserved to inform the compiler whether we are writing a contract, script, predicate, or library. To designate the file as a contract, use the `contract` keyword.
<CodeImport
  file="../../../intro-to-sway/contract/src/main.sw"
  comment="contract"
  commentType="//"
  lang="sway"
/>

## Imports

The [Sway standard library](https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway/tree/master/sway-lib-std) provides several utility types and methods we can use in our contract. To import a library, you can use the `use` keyword and `::`, also called a namespace qualifier, to chain library names like this:

<CodeImport
  file="../../../intro-to-sway/contract/src/docs_hub_misc.sw"
  comment="import_single"
  commentType="//"
  lang="sway"
/>

You can also group together imports using curly brackets:

<CodeImport
  file="../../../intro-to-sway/contract/src/docs_hub_misc.sw"
  comment="import_multi"
  commentType="//"
  lang="sway"
/>

For this contract, here is what needs to be imported:

<CodeImport
  file="../../../intro-to-sway/contract/src/main.sw"
  comment="import"
  commentType="//"
  lang="sway"
/>

We'll go through what each of these imports does as we use them in the next steps.
