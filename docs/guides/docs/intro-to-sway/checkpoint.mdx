# Checkpoint

## Sway Contract Checkpoint

If you have followed the previous steps correctly your `main.sw` marketplace contract should look like this:

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/intro-to-sway/sway-store/sway-programs/contract/src/main.sw"
  comment="all"
  commentType="//"
  lang="sway"
/>

## Building the contract

Here's a polished version of your instructions:

To format your contract, execute the command:

<TestAction
id="format-contract"
action={{
  name: 'runCommand',
  commandFolder: 'guides-testing/sway-store/sway-programs/contract'
}}
/>

```sh
forc fmt
```

To compile your contract, navigate to the contract folder and run:

<TestAction
id="build-contract"
action={{
  name: 'runCommand',
  commandFolder: 'guides-testing/sway-store/sway-programs/contract'
}}
/>

```sh
forc build
```

Congratulations! You've successfully written a full contract in Sway!

Post-compilation, the system will automatically generate `abi.json`, `storage_slots.json`, and `contract.bin`. You can locate these files in the following directory:

```sh
contract/out/debug/*
```

## Deploying the contract

For detailed steps on deploying this contract, refer to the official Fuel developer counter dapp guide:
[Deploy the Contract](/guides/counter-dapp/building-a-smart-contract/#deploy-the-contract)

To deploy, use the following command if you've already set up the forc-wallet and have testnet funds in your account. If not, follow the instructions above.

```sh
forc deploy --testnet
```

After deploying, you'll be able to find your contract ID in the `contract/out/deployments` folder. You'll need this for frontend integration.
