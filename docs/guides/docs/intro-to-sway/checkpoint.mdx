## Sway Contract Checkpoint

If you have followed the previous steps correctly your `main.sw` marketplace contract should look like this

<CodeImport
  file="../../../intro-to-sway/contract/src/main.sw"
  comment="all"
  commentType="//"
  lang="sway"
/>

## Building the contract

Here's a polished version of your instructions:

To format your contract, execute the command:
```
forc fmt
```

To compile your contract, navigate to the contract folder and run:
```
forc build
```
Congratulations! You've successfully written a full contract in Sway!

Post-compilation, the system will automatically generate `abi.json`, `storage_slots.json`, and `contract.bin`. You can locate these files in the following directory:
```
contract/out/debug/*
```

## Deploying the contract

For detailed steps on deploying this contract, refer to the official Fuel developer quickstart guide: 
[Deploy the Contract](https://fuelbook.fuel.network/master/quickstart/smart-contract.html#deploy-the-contract)

To deploy, use the following command:
```bash
forc-deploy --node-url https://beta-4.fuel.network/graphql --gas-price 1 --gas-limit 1000000
```

After deploying, remember to save your contract ID. You'll need it for frontend integrations.
