# Github Codespace

### Introduction

The way to think about [Github Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) is essentially VSCode in a browser. It‚Äôs a remote development environment that is extremely easy to spin up. While not all VS Code plugins are supported, the Sway LSP plugin is supported and works out of the box.

### How to set up for a new repo

1. Create a devcontainer.json file. The easiest way is by navigating to the repo and clicking Code ‚Üí ‚Ä¶ ‚Üí Configure dev container

2. Edit the file to include the following features:
    
    ```json
    "features": {
        "ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/common-utils:1": {},
        "ghcr.io/FuelLabs/devcontainer-features/fuelup:1.0.1": {},
    }
    ```
    
3. Add any plugins that you want to be installed for this repo under ‚Äúcustomizations‚Äù. 
    
    ```json
    "customizations": {
        "vscode": {
            "extensions": [
                "fuellabs.sway-vscode-plugin"
            ]
        }
    }
    ```
    
    Here are examples that include the Sway LSP plugin.
    
    3.1. [https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway/blob/master/.devcontainer/devcontainer.json](https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway/blob/master/.devcontainer/devcontainer.json)
   
    3.2. [https://github.com/FuelLabs/quickstart/blob/master/.devcontainer/devcontainer.json](https://github.com/FuelLabs/quickstart/blob/master/.devcontainer/devcontainer.json)

### How to start a codespace

1. Navigate to the repo that has Github Codespaces configured.
2. Choose Code ‚Üí Create codespace on master

3. This will open a new tab with your codespace. It can take several minutes to start up. 

    3.1.  You now have a fully functional remote dev environment with the Fuel toolchain installed! You can use `forc` to build and deploy Sway code, or `fuelup` to manage the toolchain version. You also have the Sway LSP plugin with full feature support for Sway, like syntax highlighting, hover docs, go-to definitions, etc. 
   
    3.2. Note: if you are working on a large repository and find the codespace is running slow, you can configure it to use a larger instance by clicking Code ‚Üí ‚Ä¶ ‚Üí change machine type on a running instance, or starting a new instance with Code ‚Üí ‚Ä¶ ‚Üí New with options.

### Pricing & billing

You will be required to enter billing information, however there is a substantial free tier.
