# Toolchain installation

This guide will help you to install the Fuel toolchain binaries and prerequisites.

This guide covers the following topics:

1. [Installing Rust](#installing-rust)
2. [Installing the Fuel toolchain using `fuelup`](#installing-the-fuel-toolchain-using-fuelup)
3. [Changing your default toolchain](#changing-your-default-toolchain)
4. [Setting up a local wallet](#setting-up-a-local-wallet)

## Installing Rust

{/*install_rust:example:start*/}
The Fuel toolchain is built on top of the Rust programming language. To install Rust, you can use the `rustup` tool.
{/*install_rust:example:end*/}

Run the following command in your shell; this downloads and runs `rustup-init.sh`, which in turn downloads and runs the correct version of the `rustup-init` executable for your platform.

{/*ANCHOR: install_rust_command*/}

```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

{/*ANCHOR: install_rust_command*/}

Check the official Rust documentation to get more information on [installing the Rust toolchain](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

## Installing the Fuel toolchain using fuelup

`fuelup` is the official package manager for Fuel that installs the Fuel toolchain
from the official release channels, enabling you to easily switch between different
toolchains and keep them updated. It makes building and maintaining Sway applications simpler with [`forc`](/docs/forc) and [`fuel-core`](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core) for common platforms.

> 💡 Check out the [fuelup docs](/docs/fuelup) for more information.

### Running `fuelup-init`

{/*install_fuelup:example:start*/}
To install the Fuel toolchain, you'll use the `fuelup-init` script.
This will install `forc`, `forc-client`, `forc-fmt`, `forc-lsp`, `forc-wallet` as well as `fuel-core` in `~/.fuelup/bin`.
{/*install_fuelup:example:end*/}

👉 Just paste the following line in your terminal and press *Enter*.

{/*ANCHOR: install_fuelup_command*/}

```sh
curl -sSf https://install.fuel.network/fuelup-init.sh | sh
```

{/*ANCHOR_END: install_fuelup_command*/}

> 🚧 Be aware that currently  we do not natively support Windows. If you wish to use `fuelup` on Windows, please use Windows Subsystem for Linux.

### Setup PATH

Once the script is downloaded, it will be executed automatically.
The `fuelup-init` script will prompt you with the question below:

```sh
fuelup uses "/home/username/.fuelup" as its home directory to manage the Fuel toolchain, and will install binaries there.

To use the toolchain, you will have to configure your PATH, which tells your machine where to locate `fuelup` and the Fuel toolchain.

If permitted, fuelup-init will configure your PATH for you by running the following:

    echo "export PATH="$HOME/.fuelup/bin:$PATH"" >> /home/username/.bashrc

Would you like fuelup-init to modify your PATH variable for you? (N/y)
```

👉 Press the `Y` key in your terminal and press *Enter* to modify your PATH.

### Checking the installation

After allowing the `fuelup-init` script to modify your `PATH` variable, you will see a lot of information about packages being downloaded and installed. If everything goes as expected you will see the following message:

```sh
The Fuel toolchain is installed and up to date

fuelup 0.20.0 has been installed in /home/username/.fuelup/bin. 
To fetch the latest toolchain containing the forc and fuel-core binaries, run 'fuelup toolchain install latest'. 
To generate completions for your shell, run 'fuelup completions --shell=SHELL'.
```

👉 Use `fuelup --version` any time to check which version of the package you are using.

```sh
 fuelup --version
```

That will output your current `fuelup` version:

```sh
fuelup 0.21.0
```

### VSCode extensions

{/*install_VSCode_extensions:example:start*/}
If you're using VSCode, we recommend installing the following extensions:

- [Sway](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=FuelLabs.sway-vscode-plugin): Sway language support
- [rust-analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer): Rust language support
{/*install_VSCode_extensions:example:end*/}

## Changing your default toolchain

Just as in [Rust](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/concepts/toolchains.html), Fuel supports multiple toolchains.
A toolchain is a collection of tools (such as the compiler, LSP, etc).
By default, `fuelup` includes a series of packages tested to work with each other, providing a reliable set of tools.

The default toolchain configured when you install `fuelup` is the `latest` toolchain, which is the stable toolchain compatible with the current {props.fuelTestnetInlineCode} network.

### Updating fuelup

Make sure you have the latest version of `fuelup` so you can access the latest features and have the best performance.

👉 Update `fuelup`  by running the following command:

```sh
fuelup self update
```

Then you will get an output like this:

```sh
Fetching binary from https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuelup/releases/download/v0.19.5/fuelup-0.19.5-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz
Downloading component fuelup without verifying checksum
Unpacking and moving fuelup to /var/folders/tp/0l8zdx9j4s9_n609ykwxl0qw0000gn/T/.tmpiNJQHt
Moving /var/folders/tp/0l8zdx9j4s9_n609ykwxl0qw0000gn/T/.tmpiNJQHt/fuelup to /Users/.fuelup/bin/fuelup
```

### Using the latest toolchain

The {props.fuelTestnetInlineCode} network is the latest Fuel testnet.
This includes public infrastructure such as the {props.faucetLink} and the {props.GQLPlaygroundLink}.

To properly interact with the {props.fuelTestnetInlineCode} network it is necessary to use the `latest` toolchain which is installed by default.

👉 Run the following command to verify the installation of `latest` toolchain:

```sh
fuelup show
```

If the toolchain was successfully installed, you will see this output:

```sh
installed toolchains
--------------------
latest-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu (default)

active toolchain
-----------------
latest-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu (default)
...
```

### Installing `nightly` toolchain

In case you want to try out the unreleased features of the Fuel toolchain, you can install the `nightly` toolchain.

👉 Run the following command to install the `nightly` toolchain:

```sh
fuelup toolchain install nightly
```

If the toolchain was successfully installed, you will see this output:

```sh
The Fuel toolchain is installed and up to date
```

The toolchain was installed correctly, however is not in use yet. Next, you need to configure `fuelup` to use the `nightly` toolchain as the default.

{/*set_default_testnet:example:start*/}
👉 Set `nightly` as your default toolchain with the following command:
{/*set_default_testnet:example:end*/}

{/*ANCHOR: set_default_testnet_command*/}

```sh
fuelup default nightly 
```

{/*ANCHOR_END: set_default_testnet_command*/}

You will get the following output indicating that you have successfully set `nightly` as your default toolchain.

```sh
default toolchain set to nightly
```

### Checking your current toolchain

Sometimes you might end up using multiple toolchains at once.
Don't worry if you get confused about which toolchain you are using, since you can check your current toolchain anytime.

👉 Run the `fuelup show` command to see the toolchain and the versions of each tool you are using.

```sh
fuelup show
```

This command will give you the following output

```sh
active toolchain
-----------------
beta-4-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu (default)
  forc : 0.45.0
    - forc-client
      - forc-deploy : 0.45.0
      - forc-run : 0.45.0
    - forc-doc : 0.45.0
    - forc-explore : 0.28.1
    - forc-fmt : 0.45.0
    - forc-index : 0.20.7
    - forc-lsp : 0.45.0
    - forc-tx : 0.45.0
    - forc-wallet : 0.3.0
  fuel-core : 0.20.4
  fuel-core-keygen : Error getting version string
  fuel-indexer : 0.20.7

fuels versions
---------------
forc : 0.45
forc-wallet : 0.45
```

As you can see, the {props.fuelTestnetInlineCode} toolchain is active 🚀

## Setting up a local wallet

The `forc-wallet` plugin is packaged alongside the default distributed toolchains when installed using `fuelup`, so you should already have this installed if you've followed the instructions above.

To initialize a new wallet with `forc-wallet`, you can run the command below:

```console
forc wallet new
```

After typing in a password, be sure to save the mnemonic phrase that is output.

Next, create a new wallet account with:

```console
forc wallet account new
```

With this, you'll get a fuel address that looks something like this: `fuel1efz7lf36w9da9jekqzyuzqsfrqrlzwtt3j3clvemm6eru8fe9nvqj5kar8`.

If you need to list your accounts, you can run the command below:

```console
forc wallet accounts
```
