# Running a local Fuel node

In addition to deploying and testing on the Fuel Testnet, you can also run a local Fuel Node.

There are two types of Fuel networks that can be run:

1. In-memory network (without persistance)
2. Local network with persistance

## In-memory local node (without state persistance)

An in-memory node does not persist the blockchain state anywhere, it is only stored in memory as long as the node is active and running.

To spin-up a local in-memory Fuel node, run the following command:

```sh
fuel-core run --db-type in-memory
```

To deploy a contract to the local node, run the following command:

```sh
forc deploy <signing-key> --url 127.0.0.1:4000/graphql
```

Or to deploy without using a signing key:

```sh
forc deploy --unsigned --url 127.0.0.1:4000/graphql
```

## Local node (with state persistance)

This node does persist the blockchain state locally.

To run a local node with persistance, you must configure a `chainConfig.json` file. Here is an example of what that looks like:

```json
{
  "chain_name": "local_testnet",
  "block_production": {
    "ProofOfAuthority": {
      "trigger": "instant"
    }
  },

      },

    }
  }
}
```

To start the node, run the following command:

```sh
fuel-core run --ip 127.0.0.1 --port 4000 --chain ./chainConfig.json --db-path ./.fueldb
```

## Connecting to the local node from a browser wallet

To connect to the local node using a browser wallet, import the network address as:

```sh
http://127.0.0.1:4000/graphql
```
