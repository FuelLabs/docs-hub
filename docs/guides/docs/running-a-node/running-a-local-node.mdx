# Running a local Fuel node

In addition to deploying and testing on the Fuel Testnet, you can also run a local Fuel Node.

There are two types of Fuel networks that can be run:

1. In-memory network (without persistence)
2. Local network with persistence

## In-memory local node (without state persistence)

An in-memory node does not persist the blockchain state anywhere, it is only stored in memory as long as the node is active and running.

To spin-up a local in-memory Fuel node, run the following command:

```sh
fuel-core run --db-type in-memory --debug
```

To deploy a contract to the local node, run the following command:

```sh
forc deploy <signing-key> --node-url 127.0.0.1:4000/graphql
```

Or to deploy without using a signing key:

```sh
forc deploy --unsigned --node-url 127.0.0.1:4000/graphql
```

## Chain Configuration

To modify the initial state of the chain, you must configure a `chainConfig.json` file.
Here is an example of what that looks like using version {props.versionSet === '0.20.4' ? 'beta-4' : props.fuelCoreVersion} of `fuel-core`:

<ConditionalContent versionSet={props.versionSet} showForVersions={['default', 'nightly']}>
<CodeImport
  file="../../../fuel-core/deployment/scripts/chainspec/dev_chainspec.json"
  lang="json"
/>
</ConditionalContent>

<ConditionalContent versionSet={props.versionSet} showForVersions={['beta-4']}>
<CodeImport
  file="../../../beta-4/fuel-core/deployment/scripts/chainspec/dev_chainspec.json"
  lang="json"
/>
</ConditionalContent>

To start the node with a custom configuration, you can use the command below:

```sh
fuel-core run --chain ./chainConfig.json --db-type in-memory --debug
```

To find an example chain configuration file for a specific `fuel-core` version, refer to the [`fuel-core`](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/tree/master/deployment/scripts/chainspec) repo.

### Funding a wallet locally

You can edit the `coins` array inside the `inital_state` object to modify the initial assets owned by a given address.

The `owner` address must be a `B256` type address (begins with `0x`) instead of a `Bech32` type (begins with `fuel`).

The `amount` is a hex value. In this example, the value translates to `1,125,899.9 ETH`.

## Local node (with state persistence)

This node does persist the blockchain state locally.
To run a local node with persistence a chain configuration file is required.

To start the node, run the following command:

```sh
fuel-core run --ip 127.0.0.1 --port 4000 --chain ./chainConfig.json --db-path ./.fueldb --debug
```

## Connecting to the local node from a browser wallet

To connect to the local node using a browser wallet, import the network address as:

```sh
http://127.0.0.1:4000/graphql
```
