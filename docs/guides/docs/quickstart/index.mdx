# Developer Quickstart

This guide will walk developers through writing a smart contract in Sway, a simple test, deploying to Fuel, and building a frontend.

Before we begin, it may be helpful to understand the terminology that will be used throughout the docs and how they relate to each other:

- **Fuel**: the Fuel blockchain.
- **FuelVM**: the virtual machine powering Fuel.
- **Sway**: the domain-specific language crafted for the FuelVM; it is inspired by Rust.
- **Forc**: the build system and package manager for Sway, similar to Cargo for Rust.
