# Building a Frontend to Interact With Your Contract

To build out our frontend application, we'll do the following:

1. [**Install the Fuel Browser Wallet.**](#install-the-fuel-browser-wallet)
2. [**Initialize a React project.**](#initialize-a-react-project)
3. [**Install the `fuels` SDK dependency.**](#install-the-fuels-sdk-dependency)
4. [**Write our frontend code.**](#modify-the-app)
5. [**Run our project.**](#run-your-project)

## Install the Fuel Browser Wallet

> Note: Make sure your browser is using the latest version of chromium.

Our front end application will need to interact with the Fuel Network, so we'll need to have a browser wallet installed for us to do so.

Before going to the next steps, install the Fuel Wallet [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fuel-wallet/dldjpboieedgcmpkchcjcbijingjcgok).

If you have previously installed the wallet, make sure you have updated to the latest version.

Once you've installed the wallet, take the address of your wallet and use it to get some coins from [the testnet faucet](https://faucet-beta-4.fuel.network/).

## Initialize a React project

To split our project's contract from frontend code, let's initialize our frontend project: assuming that your terminal is open at your contract's folder `/home/user/path/to/counter-contract` let's go back up one directory.

```console
cd ..
```

Now, initialize a react project using [`Create React App`](https://create-react-app.dev/).

```console
npx create-react-app frontend --template typescript
```

The output should be similar to:

```console
Success! Created frontend at Fuel/fuel-project/frontend
```

You should now have your outer folder, `fuel-project`, with two folders inside: `counter-contract` and `frontend`

### Install the `fuels` SDK dependency

The `fuels` umbrella package includes all the main tools you need for your frontend; `Wallet`, `Contracts`, `Providers`, and more.

Also, it contains the routines for ABI TypeScript generation.

> ABI stands for Application Binary Interface. ABI's inform the application the interface to interact with the VM, in other words, they provide info to the APP such as what methods a contract has, what params, types it expects, etc...

### Installing

Move into the `frontend` folder, then run:

```console
cd frontend
```

Install `fuels` and `@fuel-wallet/sdk`.

```console
npm install fuels@0.60.0 @fuel-wallet/sdk@0.13.0 --save
```

If the installation went correctly the result will be similar to this:

```console
added 114 packages, and audited 115 packages in 9s
```

Next, update the TypeScript configuration at `tsconfig.json` to add the Fuel Wallet types:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "types": ["@fuel-wallet/sdk"]
  }
}
```

### Generating contract types

To make it easier to interact with our contract we use `fuels typegen` command to interpret the output ABI JSON from our contract, and generate Typescript definitions based on it. This JSON was created when we executed the `forc build` command to compile our Sway Contract into binary.

If you see the folder `fuel-project/counter-contract/out` you will be able to see the ABI JSON there. If you want to learn more, read the [ABI spec](https://fuellabs.github.io/fuel-specs/master/protocol/abi).

Inside the `fuel-project/frontend` directory run:

```console
npx fuels typegen -i ../counter-contract/out/debug/*-abi.json -o ./src/contracts
```

A successful process should print and output like the following:

```console
Generating files..

 - src/contracts/CounterContractAbi.d.ts
 - src/contracts/factories/CounterContractAbi__factory.ts
 - src/contracts/index.ts

Done.âš¡
```

Now you should be able to find a new folder `fuel-project/frontend/src/contracts`. This folder was auto-generated by our `fuels typegen` command, and these files abstract the work we would need to do to create a contract instance, and generate a complete TypeScript interface to the Contract, making easy to develop.

### Modify the App

Inside the `frontend/src` folder let's add code that interacts with our contract.
Change the file `fuel-project/frontend/src/App.tsx` to:

File: `./frontend/src/App.tsx`

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/quickstart/frontend/src/App.tsx"
  lang="tsx"
/>

Finally, replace the value of the `CONTRACT_ID` variable at the top of your `App.tsx` file with the address of the contract you just deployed.

### Run your project

Inside the `fuel-project/frontend` directory run:

```console
npm start
```

```console
Compiled successfully!

You can now view frontend in the browser.

  Local:            http://localhost:3000
  On Your Network:  http://192.168.4.48:3000

Note that the development build is not optimized.
To create a production build, use npm run build.
```

### You just built a fullstack dapp on Fuel! â›½

[Here is the repo for this project](https://github.com/FuelLabs/quickstart). If you run into any problems, a good first step is to compare your code to this repo and resolve any differences.

Tweet us [@fuel_network](https://twitter.com/fuel_network) letting us know you just built a dapp on Fuel, you might get invited to a private group of builders, be invited to the next Fuel dinner, get alpha on the project, or something ðŸ‘€.

### Updating The Contract

If you make changes to your contract, here are the steps you should take to get your frontend and contract back in sync:

- In your contract directory, run `forc build`
- In your contract directory, redeploy the contract by running this command and following the same steps as above to sign the transaction with your wallet: `forc deploy --testnet`
- In your frontend directory, re-run this command: `npx fuels typegen -i ../counter-contract/out/debug/*-abi.json -o ./src/contracts`
- In your `fuel-project/frontend` directory, update the contract ID in your `App.tsx` file
