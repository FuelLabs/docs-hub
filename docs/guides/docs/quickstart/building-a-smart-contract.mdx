### Already have `fuelup` installed?

If you already have `fuelup` installed, run the commands below to make sure you are on the most up-to-date toolchain.

<ConditionalContent versionSet={props.versionSet} showForVersions={['beta-4']}>

```sh
fuelup toolchain install beta-4
fuelup default beta-4
```

</ConditionalContent>

<ConditionalContent versionSet={props.versionSet} showForVersions={['default', 'nightly']}>

```sh
fuelup self update
fuelup update
fuelup default latest
```

</ConditionalContent>

## Your First Sway Project

<ConditionalContent versionSet={props.versionSet} showForVersions={['default', 'nightly']}>
<QuickstartCallout>
<CodeTabs>

```sh
pnpm create fuels
```

```sh
npm create fuels
```

We'll build a simple counter contract with two functions: one to increment the counter, and one to return the value of the counter.

**Start by creating a new, empty folder. We'll call it `fuel-project`.**

<TestAction
id="create-project-folder"
action={{
  name: 'runCommand',
  commandFolder: 'guides-testing'
}}
/>

```sh
mkdir fuel-project
```

### Writing the Contract

Move inside of your `fuel-project` folder:

```sh
cd fuel-project
```

Then create a contract project using `forc`:

<TestAction
id="create-contract"
action={{
  name: 'runCommand',
  commandFolder: 'guides-testing/fuel-project'
}}
/>

```sh
forc new counter-contract
```

You will get this output:

```sh
To compile, use `forc build`, and to run tests use `forc test`

{/*This example should include a tree for a new `forc` project and explain the boilerplate files*/}
{/*forc_new:example:start*/}
Here is the project that `forc` has initialized:

<TestAction
id="contract-tree"
action={{
  name: 'runCommand',
  commandFolder: 'guides-testing/fuel-project'
}}
/>

```sh
tree counter-contract
```

```sh
counter-contract
├── Forc.toml
└── src
    └── main.sw

1 directory, 2 files
```

`forc.toml` is the *manifest file* (similar to `Cargo.toml` for Cargo or `package.json` for Node) and defines project metadata such as the project name and dependencies.
{/*forc_new:example:end*/}

Open your project in a code editor and delete everything in `src/main.sw` apart from the first line.

Every Sway file must start with a declaration of what type of program the file contains; here, we've declared that this file is a contract.
You can learn more about Sway program types in the [Sway Book](/docs/sway/sway-program-types/).

<TestAction
id="program-type"
action={{
  name: 'writeToFile',
  filepath: 'guides-testing/fuel-project/counter-contract/src/main.sw'
}}
/>

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/quickstart/counter-contract/src/main.sw"
  comment="contract"
  commentType="//"
  lang="sway"
/>

Next, we'll define a storage value.
In our case, we have a single counter that we'll call `counter` of type `u64` (a 64-bit unsigned integer) and initialize it to 0.

<TestAction
id="storage"
action={{
  name: 'modifyFile',
  filepath: 'guides-testing/fuel-project/counter-contract/src/main.sw'
}}
/>

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/quickstart/counter-contract/src/main.sw"
  comment="storage"
  commentType="//"
  lang="sway"
/>

### ABI

ABI stands for Application Binary Interface.
An ABI defines an interface for a contract.
A contract must either define or import an ABI declaration.

It is considered best practice to define your ABI in a separate library and import it into your contract.
This allows callers of the contract to import and use the ABI more easily.

For simplicity, we will define the ABI directly in the contract file itself.

<TestAction
id="abi"
action={{
  name: 'modifyFile',
  filepath: 'guides-testing/fuel-project/counter-contract/src/main.sw'
}}
/>

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/quickstart/counter-contract/src/main.sw"
  comment="abi"
  commentType="//"
  lang="sway"
/>

### Implement ABI

Below your ABI definition, you will write the implementation of the functions defined in your ABI.

<TestAction
id="impl"
action={{
  name: 'modifyFile',
  filepath: 'guides-testing/fuel-project/counter-contract/src/main.sw'
}}
/>

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/quickstart/counter-contract/src/main.sw"
  comment="counter-contract"
  commentType="//"
  lang="sway"
/>

> `storage.counter.read()` is an implicit return and is equivalent to `return storage.counter.read();`.

Here's what your code should look like so far:

File: `./counter-contract/src/main.sw`

<TestAction
id="entire-contract"
action={{
  name: 'compareToFile',
  filepath: 'guides-testing/fuel-project/counter-contract/src/main.sw'
}}
/>

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/quickstart/counter-contract/src/main.sw"
  comment="all"
  commentType="/*"
  lang="sway"
/>

### Build the Contract

Navigate to your contract folder:

```sh
cd counter-contract
```

Then run the following command to build your contract:

<TestAction
id="build-contract"
action={{
  name: 'runCommand',
  commandFolder: 'guides-testing/fuel-project/counter-contract'
}}
/>

```sh
forc build
```

```sh
  Compiled library "core".
  Compiled library "std".
  Compiled contract "counter-contract".
  Bytecode size: 84 bytes.
```

Let's have a look at the content of the `counter-contract` folder after building:

<TestAction
id="built-contract-tree"
action={{
  name: 'runCommand',
  commandFolder: 'guides-testing/fuel-project/counter-contract'
}}
/>

```sh
tree .
```

```sh
.
├── Forc.lock
├── Forc.toml
├── out
│   └── debug
│       ├── counter-contract-abi.json
│       ├── counter-contract-storage_slots.json
│       └── counter-contract.bin
└── src
    └── main.sw

3 directories, 6 files
```

We now have an `out` directory that contains our build artifacts such as the JSON representation of our ABI and the contract bytecode.

## Testing your Contract with Rust

> Don't want to test with Rust? Skip this section and jump to [Deploy the Contract](#deploy-the-contract).

We will start by adding a Rust integration test harness using a Cargo generate template.
If you don't already have `Rust` installed, you can install it by running this command:

<CodeImport
  file="../installation/index.mdx"
  comment="install_rust_command"
  commentType="{/*"
  lang="sh"
  trim="true"
/>

Next, if you don't already have it installed, let's install [`cargo generate`](https://github.com/cargo-generate/cargo-generate):

```sh
cargo install cargo-generate --locked
```

Now, let's generate the default test harness with the following command:

<TestAction
id="cargo-generate-test"
action={{
  name: 'runCommand',
  commandFolder: 'guides-testing/fuel-project/counter-contract'
}}
/>

```sh
cargo generate --init fuellabs/sway templates/sway-test-rs --name counter-contract
```

```sh
⚠️   Favorite `fuellabs/sway` not found in config, using it as a git repository: https://github.com/fuellabs/sway.git
🔧   Destination: /home/user/path/to/counter-contract ...
🔧   project-name: counter-contract ...
🔧   Generating template ...
🔧   Moving generated files into: `/home/user/path/to/counter-contract`...
✨   Done! New project created /home/user/path/to/counter-contract
```

Let's have a look at the result:

<TestAction
id="cargo-test-tree"
action={{
  name: 'runCommand',
  commandFolder: 'guides-testing/fuel-project/counter-contract'
}}
/>

```sh
tree .
```

```sh
.
├── Cargo.toml
├── Forc.lock
├── Forc.toml
├── out
│   └── debug
│       ├── counter-contract-abi.json
│       ├── counter-contract-storage_slots.json
│       └── counter-contract.bin
├── src
│   └── main.sw
└── tests
    └── harness.rs

4 directories, 8 files
```

We have two new files!

- The `Cargo.toml` is the manifest for our new test harness and specifies the required dependencies including `fuels` (the Fuel Rust SDK).
- The `tests/harness.rs` contains some boilerplate test code to get us started, though doesn't call any contract methods just yet.

Now that we have our default test harness, let's add a useful test to it.

At the bottom of `test/harness.rs` below the `can_get_contract_id()` test, add the `test_increment` test function below to verify that the value of the counter gets incremented:

<TestAction
id="test-harness"
action={{
  name: 'modifyFile',
  filepath: 'guides-testing/fuel-project/counter-contract/tests/harness.rs',
  addSpacesBefore: 1,
}}
/>

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/quickstart/counter-contract/tests/harness.rs"
  comment="contract-test"
  commentType="//"
  lang="rust"
/>

Here is what your file should look like:

File: `./counter-contract/tests/harness.rs`

<TestAction
id="final-test-harness"
action={{
  name: 'compareToFile',
  filepath: 'guides-testing/fuel-project/counter-contract/tests/harness.rs'
}}
/>

<CodeImport
  file="../../examples/quickstart/counter-contract/tests/harness.rs"
  comment="contract-test-all"
  commentType="/*"
  lang="rust"
/>

Run `cargo test` in the terminal:

```sh
cargo test
```

If all goes well, the output should look as follows:

```sh
  ...
  running 2 tests
  test can_get_contract_id ... ok
  test test_increment ... ok
  test result: ok. 2 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 0.25s
```

## Deploy the Contract

It's now time to deploy . We will show how to do this using `forc` from the command line, but you can also do it using the [Rust SDK](/docs/fuels-rs/deploying) or the [TypeScript SDK](/docs/fuels-ts/contracts/deploying-contracts).

In order to deploy a contract, you need to have a wallet to sign the transaction and coins to pay for gas. `Fuelup` will guide you in this process.

### Deploy To Testnet

Now, you can deploy the contract to the latest testnet with the `forc deploy --testnet` command.

If you don't have a wallet installed, the terminal will help you to create one. Then you can use the {props.faucetLink} to get some testnet coins.

<ConditionalContent versionSet={props.versionSet} showForVersions={['beta-4']}>

```sh
forc deploy --node-url https://beta-4.fuel.network/graphql --gas-price 1
```

</ConditionalContent>

<ConditionalContent versionSet={props.versionSet} showForVersions={['default', 'nightly']}>

```sh
forc deploy --testnet
```

</ConditionalContent>

The terminal will ask for the password of the wallet:

`Please provide the password of your encrypted wallet vault at "~/.fuel/wallets/.wallet":`

Once you have unlocked the wallet, the terminal will show a list of the accounts:

```sh
Account 0 -- fuel18caanqmumttfnm8qp0eq7u9yluydxtqmzuaqtzdjlsww5t2jmg9skutn8n:
  Asset ID                                                           Amount
  0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 499999940
```

Just below the list, you'll see this prompt:

`Please provide the index of account to use for signing:`

Then you'll enter the number of the account of preference and press `Y` when prompted to accept the transaction.

Finally, you will get back the network endpoint where the contract was deployed, a `Contract ID` and the block where the transaction was signed.
Save the `Contract ID`, as you'll need this later to connect the frontend.
