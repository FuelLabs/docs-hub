If you've already setup a Solana account from Ledger, you won't be able to sign messages required by Fuel. This means you can't move your funds or connect your account.

To fix this issue, you'll need to import your seed phrase into a hot wallet, then use the hot wallet to sign. Here's a guide with details on how to do it.

> **Warning:** Only follow these steps if you understand the risks of exposing your recovery phrase to a hot (internet-connected) environment. Never enter your seed phrase into an untrusted app, extension, or website. Proceed only if necessary and be prepared to move your funds immediately after signing.

## What You'll Need

- Your **24-word recovery phrase** from your Ledger device  
- A computer or phone with internet access  
- Phantom or Solflare wallet app or browser extension

## Steps to Import Your Ledger Account into a Hot Wallet

### 1. Install a Solana Hot Wallet

Choose one of the following:

- [Phantom Wallet](https://phantom.app/download)
- [Solflare Wallet](https://solflare.com/download)

Install the browser extension or mobile app as needed.

---

### 2. Start Wallet Setup and Choose "Import Wallet"

Open the wallet and look for an option like:

- "Use Secret Recovery Phrase"
- "I already have a wallet"

Select this to proceed with importing your existing wallet.

---

### 3. Enter Your 24-Word Ledger Recovery Phrase

When prompted, carefully enter the 24 words from your Ledger device.

**Important:**
- Ensure that you are in a secure and private environment.
- Do not reuse this wallet for long-term storage after completing the operation.

### 4. Derive the Correct Solana Account

Solana wallets use specific derivation paths.

#### For Phantom Wallet:

- Phantom supports multiple derivation paths, including those used by Ledger.
- However, [Phantom will only detect Ledger derivation paths if activity (transactions or balance) is found on those paths](https://help.phantom.app/hc/en-us/articles/12988493966227-What-derivation-paths-does-Phantom-wallet-support-).
- If your Ledger-derived Solana account has prior activity, Phantom should automatically display it after import.
- If the correct account does not appear, consider using a wallet like Solflare that allows manual derivation path selection.

#### For Solflare Wallet:

- Solflare allows manual selection of derivation paths.
- Use the path: `m/44'/501'/0'/0'`
- If you don't see the correct address, try other account indexes or check advanced import options.

### 5. Sign the Required Message in the Fuel App

Once your account is imported and visible:

- Reconnect the hot wallet to the Fuel app.
- Sign the required message to authorize your Fuel predicate account.

---

### 6. Immediately Move Your Funds to a Secure Wallet

After signing:

- Send your assets to a secure wallet (hardware wallet or trusted address).
- Do not leave assets in the imported hot wallet.

---

## Important Security Notice

- This method is for recovery only and is **not recommended for long-term use**.
- Exposing your recovery phrase in a hot wallet poses serious security risks.
- After completing the process, delete the wallet from your browser or device.
