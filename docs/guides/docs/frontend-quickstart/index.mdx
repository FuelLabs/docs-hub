# Next.js Fullstack Quickstart

Getting started with Fuel as a frontend or fullstack developer is as simple as:

1. [Installing](#installation) `fuelup`
2. [Generating a counter dapp](#generating-a-counter-dapp)
3. [Running the project locally](#running-the-project-locally)

## Installation

<TextImport
  file="../installation/index.mdx"
  comment="install_fuelup"
  commentType="{/*"
/>

<CodeImport
  file="../installation/index.mdx"
  comment="install_fuelup_command"
  commentType="{/*"
  lang="sh"
  trim="true"
/>

<TextImport
  file="../counter-dapp/building-a-smart-contract.mdx"
  comment="install_help"
  commentType="{/*"
/>

<TextImport
  file="../installation/index.mdx"
  comment="install_VSCode_extensions"

/>

### Already have `fuelup` installed?

## Generating a counter dapp

You can generate a full-stack counter dapp in seconds with the `create fuels` CLI:

<CodeTabs>

```sh
pnpm create fuels
```

```sh
npm create fuels
```

</CodeTabs>

## Running the project locally

Move into the project directory. Assuming you named the project `my-fuel-project`, you can run:

```sh
cd my-fuel-project
```

Next, run the following command to start a local development node:

<CodeTabs>

```sh
pnpm fuels:dev
```

```sh
npm run fuels:dev
```

</CodeTabs>

The local endpoint for node will be `http://localhost:4000/v1/graphql`.

Next, open a new terminal in the project directory, and run the following command to start the frontend:

<CodeTabs>

```sh
pnpm dev
```

```sh
npm run dev
```

</CodeTabs>

The frontend will be running at [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000).

While the local node is running, any changes you make to the Sway contract inside the `sway-contract` folder will automatically trigger several updates:

1. The contract gets rebuilt using the `forc build` command.
2. The contract will be redeployed to the local node using the `forc deploy` command .
3. New TypeScript types for the contract and a file called `contract-ids.json` with the new contract ID will be generated in the `src/sway-api` folder.

This means you don't need to worry about updating the contract ID, ABI, or TypeScript types while you develop.
