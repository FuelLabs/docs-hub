# Building a Frontend to Interact With Your Contract

To build out our frontend application, we'll do the following:

1. **Install the Fuel Browser Wallet.**
2. **Initialize a React project.**
3. **Install the `fuels` SDK dependencies.**
4. **Write our frontend code.**
5. **Run our project.**

## Install the Fuel Browser Wallet

Our front end application will need to interact with the Fuel Network, so we'll need to have a browser wallet installed for us to do so.

Before going to the next steps, install the [Fuel Wallet](/docs/wallet/install).

Once you've installed the wallet, take the address of your wallet and use it to get some coins from [the testnet faucet](https://faucet-beta-3.fuel.network/).

## Initialize a React project

To split our project's contract from frontend code, let's create a new folder `frontend` where we'll initialize our frontend project.

In the terminal, go back up one directory and initialize a react project using [`Create React App`](https://create-react-app.dev/).

```console
$ cd ..
$ npx create-react-app frontend --template typescript
Success! Created frontend at Fuel/fuel-project/frontend
```

You should now have your outer folder, `fuel-project`, with two folders inside: `counter-contract` and `frontend`

### Install the `fuels` SDK dependency

The `fuels` umbrella package includes all the main tools you need for your frontend; `Wallet`, `Contracts`, `Providers`, and more.

Also, it contains the routines for ABI TypeScript generation.

> ABI stands for Application Binary Interface. ABI's inform the application the interface to interact with the VM, in other words, they provide info to the APP such as what methods a contract has, what params, types it expects, etc...

### Installing

Move into the `frontend` folder, then run:

```console
$ cd frontend
$ npm install fuels@0.38.0 @fuel-wallet/sdk --save
added 114 packages, and audited 115 packages in 9s
```

Next, update the TypeScript configuration at `tsconfig.json` to add the Fuel Wallet types:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "types": ["@fuel-wallet/sdk"]
  }
}
```

### Generating contract types

To make it easier to interact with our contract we use `fuels typegen` command to interpret the output ABI JSON from our contract, and generate Typescript definitions based on it. This JSON was created when we executed the `forc build` command to compile our Sway Contract into binary.

If you see the folder `fuel-project/counter-contract/out` you will be able to see the ABI JSON there. If you want to learn more, read the [ABI spec](https://fuellabs.github.io/fuel-specs/master/protocol/abi).

Inside the `fuel-project/frontend` directory run:

```console
$ npx fuels typegen -i ../counter-contract/out/debug/*-abi.json -o ./src/contracts
Generating files..

 - src/contracts/CounterContractAbi.d.ts
 - src/contracts/factories/CounterContractAbi__factory.ts
 - src/contracts/index.ts

Done.âš¡
```

Now you should be able to find a new folder `fuel-project/frontend/src/contracts`. This folder was auto-generated by our `fuels typegen` command, and these files abstract the work we would need to do to create a contract instance, and generate a complete TypeScript interface to the Contract, making easy to develop.

### Modify the App

Inside the `frontend/src` folder let's add code that interacts with our contract.
Read the comments to help you understand the App parts.
Change the file `fuel-project/frontend/src/App.tsx` to:

File: `./frontend/src/App.tsx`

<CodeImport
  file="../../guide-examples/quickstart/frontend/src/App.tsx"
  lang="tsx"
/>

### Run your project

Now it's time to have fun, run the project in your browser.

Inside the `fuel-project/frontend` directory run:

```console
$ npm start
Compiled successfully!

You can now view frontend in the browser.

  Local:            http://localhost:3001
  On Your Network:  http://192.168.4.48:3001

Note that the development build is not optimized.
To create a production build, use npm run build.
```

### You just built a fullstack dapp on Fuel! â›½

[Here is the repo for this project](https://github.com/FuelLabs/quickstart). If you run into any problems, a good first step is to compare your code to this repo and resolve any differences.

Tweet us [@fuel_network](https://twitter.com/fuel_network) letting us know you just built a dapp on Fuel, you might get invited to a private group of builders, be invited to the next Fuel dinner, get alpha on the project, or something ðŸ‘€.

### Updating The Contract

If you make changes to your contract, here are the steps you should take to get your frontend and contract back in sync:

1. In your contract directory, run `forc build`
2. In your contract directory, redeploy the contract by running this command and following the same steps as above to sign the transaction with your wallet: `forc deploy --node-url beta-3.fuel.network/graphql --gas-price 1 --random-salt`
3. In your frontend directory, re-run this command: `npx fuels typegen -i ../counter-contract/out/debug/*-abi.json -o ./src/contracts`
4. In your `fuel-project/frontend` directory, update the contract ID in your `App.tsx` file
